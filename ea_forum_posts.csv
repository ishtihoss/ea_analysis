Mass False Bans for “Balance Transfer” on PC,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-ultimate-team-en/mass-false-bans-for-%E2%80%9Cbalance-transfer%E2%80%9D-on-pc/13101689,"Throwback to 24.12.25, when EA’s automated detection system flagged thousands of PlayStation accounts for “balance transfer.” After 8–10 hours, they fixed the issue and unbanned everyone with a single click. Everyone thought the problem was resolved, the Wildcards promo continued, and the money kept flowing.  Now, three weeks later, guess what’s happening on PC?  Exactly the same thing that happened on Christmas Eve.  Multiple accounts in my community have been banned over the span of just two days. Casual players, traders — you name it. I even tested the issue myself by hopping onto unused accounts, trading a few cards, and playing a couple of Rivals games. And guess what? After about 10 hours of normal gameplay, I got banned for literally no reason.  We didn’t sell coins. Most of us didn’t use any external web app add-ons or bots. Just regular Weekend League gameplay with some trading on the side to improve our teams — literally using the in-game market as intended.  My friends and I did some research to figure out what might have caused this. We reviewed the cards we bought and sold, as well as our profits and losses. Across all 14 accounts, there was exactly one common card purchased on every single account: Ibanez Winter Wildcard.  The point of this post is to make this issue public and hopefully get it noticed by someone at EA. Many people have lost their time, money, and nerves. EA Help’s policy is based almost entirely on automated responses, so when you try to appeal a ban, you’re stuck resending the same message only to get rejected by a bot 24 hours later. It’s incredibly frustrating.  I've already made a post on Reddit and X both got quite a big attention, but still no action by EA.   So please, if you’re in the same situation, upvote this post. Feel free to comment about your experience with EA Help, and if you managed to get unbanned, let us know how you did it.  Fellow EA FC 26 players — cheers.",HelmanzzWRZ,Seasoned Novice,2026-01-21T09:30:00,6 minutes ago,EA SPORTS FC™ 26 Ultimate Team,2200,30,157

Players bought on the tranfer market dissapeared,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/players-bought-on-the-tranfer-market-dissapeared/13120123,"I'm trading on the transfer market and in most days that I have time, I buy 5-30 cards for a profit.  3 days ago I bought Luis Suarez Time Warp 89 for 533.000 coins, i sent him to a treansfer list but the card just dissapeared. Of course I have checked everywhere in the club, including Quick Sell recovery but the player is nowhere.   I reported a case and recieve the same reply 2 times:  ""We’ve looked into your case, and you’re not eligible for any more content.  This can happen if you didn’t earn your content in time, or you didn’t meet a reward’s requirements. ""  It proves that noone checked it and that's bot reply. I bought a card but ""This can happen if you didn’t earn your content in time, or you didn’t meet a reward’s requirements. "" What kind of reply is that? IQ around 32 points I guess.   The case is not finished as I want to get what is missing and guess what happened today?  Exactly the same thing. Luis Suarez Time Warp 89 bought for 477.000 coins is missing after sending him to transfer list.  Is that a joke or what? Now i lost around 1 milion coins in 3 days, because of the game bug. I reported the case again but I guess the reply will be exactly the same as nooone checks it beside bots. Im spending a lot of free time to earn some coins, and due to game bug, my cards/coins are just vanished. EA its not hard to check it when i sent all of the details, including time when it happened. You must have access to data, and just have a look what happend with cards/coins. It cannot be that hard but first you must redirect a case to human being.

I’ve poured hundreds of hours into this game and trusted EA’s anti-cheat system, only to be caught in a widespread glitch that’s ruined my experience. The ""cheating"" claim in the ban notice is completely false, and the 242.2 hours of consistent, normal gameplay on my account proves it.  We all know the anti-cheat system failed catastrophically that day. I’m begging EA to take a second look at my case, dig into my activity logs, and reverse this unfair ban.

The delay is constant and makes the game almost unplayable.  Before the update, the game was much smoother. My internet connection is stable, my PC meets the system requirements, and I do not face this issue in other online games. This strongly suggests that the problem is related to the recent FC 26 update or servers.  Platform: PC  Launcher: EA App  Region: Middle East / Egypt  I kindly ask the technical team to investigate this issue as it is affecting the gameplay experience significantly for many players.  Thank you for your time and support.  Best regards,  Mohamed Reda",KALAZA19,Newcomer,2026-01-21T07:57:00,1 hour ago,FC 26 Technical Issues,33,2,0

Constant controller vibration in menus,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/constant-controller-vibration-in-menus/13110250,"Just installed on PC.    When I open FC26, my controller (Xbox) starts vibrating endlessly. It only stops when I hold RB to open the music menu, and on the avatar creation screen (where you can't open the music menu) the vibration doesn't happen, so I assume it's tied to that.  Also, when I tab out of FC26 and back in, it for some reason opens the Social screen (usually RT). Then after closing that, I am unable to open it again with RT.  Absolutely garbage UI design. Insane that this game has been out for 4 months (33% of its' lifespan realistically, when you consider that the next one will be out in 8 months) and this hasn't been fixed/addressed.     I've seen some posts about installing an Xbox app to disable vibration. No. IMAGINE having to install an additional app with every game just to make it function. How about EA, one of the world's largest videogame companies, release a game where a simple menu system functions properly.

PRO Clubs: Broken Progression System & Solutions,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/pro-clubs-broken-progression-system--solutions/13007321,"The new skill point allocation system is great—freedom to customize without following rigid node patterns. However, the experience grind is absurdly excessive and pushes players toward microtransactions.  The Problem:  To reach level 50 (minimum viable competitive level) in ONE position requires 40,000 XP:   160 Rush matches (21 hours including matchmaking)  134 casual matches (20 hours including matchmaking)  100 league matches (25 hours including matchmaking)   But here's the real issue: You start over at level 1 for EVERY position you want to play. Want to switch from Center Back to Midfielder? Another 20+ hours of grinding. Meanwhile, you're stuck at 73 overall trying to compete against pay-to-win teams of 75 overall emerald archetypes with millions of club fans.  With a $5 XP boost, you can hit level 50 in 12 matches (2 hours). The game essentially forces you to pay to be competitive.  Solutions for a Fair and Balanced Mode:   Universal Level System: Let experience carry across ALL positions. If I'm level 50 as a CB, I should start at level 40-45 when switching to CM, not level 1. Reward players for time invested, don't punish position flexibility.  Significantly Increase Base XP Rates:  Rush: 250 → 600 XP  Casual: 300 → 700 XP  League: 400 → 1,000 XP  Make the grind feel like progression, not a second job.  Higher Starting Overall (78-80): Starting at 73 overall makes you uncompetitive from day one. New players shouldn't be cannon fodder. Raise the floor so skill matters more than grind time.  Weekly Club Rewards: Implement a Division Rivals-style reward system:  Weekly XP boosts, club coins, or packs based on division  Give clubs a reason to climb divisions beyond bragging rights  Make progression feel rewarding, not pointless    Increase Weekly Training Cap: 1,000 XP per week is laughable when you need 40,000. Make it 5,000-10,000 so dedicated players can progress meaningfully without paying.  Account-Wide XP Boosts: Let XP boosts apply to your account, not per-match. If someone wants to spend money, fine—but don't make it the ONLY viable path to competitive play.   Bottom Line:  PRO Clubs should be about skill, teamwork, and fun—not who has the most time or money to grind. MMORPGs keep players engaged by making progression feel rewarding and natural. You've done the opposite: made it exhausting.  Fix the economy, respect players' time, and create a system where someone can enjoy multiple positions without treating it like a full-time job.",ShaarkkL,Rising Rookie,2026-01-21T06:29:00,3 hours ago,FC 26 Feedback & Suggestions,230,2,1

The gameplay happens in slow motion with an instant delay of multiple seconds. Even squad battles is now unplayable, with the gameplay happening in ""slow-motion"" and with 1-2 seconds of delay.   I returned the game twice before due to it being unplayable and I won't be gaslit into the whole ""it's your PC!"" thing, as I can easily run any other game on high to ultra settings.

This is very frustrating and worrying, especially thinking about the future when servers may eventually shut down.  Career Mode is a long-term experience. Many players like to revisit old saves years later, and being forced to stay online makes this impossible. We invest a lot of time into these careers, and losing them because of server dependency feels unfair.  I kindly request that EA: • Allows Live Hub careers to be converted to offline saves  OR  • Gives players the option to store these careers locally after creation  This would protect our progress and ensure long-term access, even without an internet connection.

Classic Squads made Team Management even worse,https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/classic-squads-made-team-management-even-worse/13119070,"We all know by now, that Team Management (tactic, formation, transfers...) is completely broken and useless. And we all know you don't care about fixing it (although you did alreaday in EA FC 25, but didn't care enough to do the same in EA FC 26...) because it's isn't a money grabbing cash cow like Ultimate Team i.e. ...but nevertheless people are disappointed, suffering, remorseful, because they did spent a lot of money on a unplayable game.   So to add something to the countless unawswered threads in this forum, I have to say, that Team Management got EVEN WORSE since Classic Squads have been introduced to the game. The problems so far have been: formations couldn't be changed, sometimes they did through intense work-arounds, but most of the time, they didn't and if you edited to much, an CE-108255-1 occured; you couldn't change positions of some players, they were stuck in their positions; you couldn't transfer some players...because they have a ""role"" in their squad? because of the national team there in? because of some random stuff? because of an corrupt database you don't care to fix? Nobody knows....  ...AND NOW - in addition to all of that: you are limited the amount of players you can transfer of Teams who have a Classic Team. For example: You can move Mbappe out of Real Madrid and transfer him to Monaco (if you're lucky and no other random bug occurs). But after that YOU CAN'T move Carvajal because it says the Classic XI can't have less than 18 players. Which could be worked around if you could add players to Real Madrid Classic XI (or if removing a player from the real club wouldn't remove them automatically from the Classic XI...), but you can't do that.  In conclusion: you didn't lift one finger in trying to fix (OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE!) a problem that makes this expensive game finally playable for countless people who bought it, thinking they could use it, NO YOU MADE IT EVEN WORSE!

"🔎TOTY26: Major Issues and Required Improvements.
(Part 1: Draft system)",https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-mobile-general-discussion-en/%F0%9F%94%8Etoty26-major-issues-and-required-improvements-part-1-draft-system/13114319,"Hello EA FC Mobile Team, Evil Larry is here,  The Team of the Year (TOTY) event is, unfortunately, a very disappointing experience, and I would like to explain why.  ⚠️This letter focuses only on the Draft System in both TOTY26 Draft and Kick-Off Draft.  1) Almost all draft player cards are untradable.  Solution: Make all draft players tradable, or introduce a mixed system with a high chance of obtaining a tradable player.  2) Spending 3,000 gems for one draft is too expensive considering that most 108+ players have weak traits, stats, work rates, and occasionally poor weak foot.  Solution: One draft should cost 1,500–2,250 gems max, with improved stats (e.g., passing for ST), position-appropriate workrates (high attack for forwards and CAM, CM, LM, RM and also RB and LB, high defense for defenders and CDMs), more traits (5+), and better weak foot stars.  3) While 10 drafts for a guaranteed untradable Pool B card is acceptable, Pool A is terrible—spending 300,000 gems or 20,000 FC points for 100 drafts to get a 116–117 OVR card is unreasonable. Additionally, Pool A and B have very few 115+ cards, lack positional diversity, and offer fewer high-ranking players compared to other events.  Solution: Include even more tradable players as suggested earlier, increase the total number of cards, reduce the number of drafts needed for a Pool A card, raise the number of high OVR cards (115+), and ensure better diversity of positions.  4) I think the refresh system for Pool A and Pool B drafts is poorly designed, especially when players obtain non-guaranteed Pool A or B cards.  Solution: No draft refresh until a guaranteed card is obtained.  5) The probability of obtaining a high OVR card is extremely low (e.g., 0.33% for a Pool A card in TOTY26 Draft and 0.25% in Welcome Draft). Additionally, the number of guaranteed coins in the draft is very low.  Solution: Slightly increase the probability of obtaining high OVR cards and provide a medium to high number of guaranteed coins.  6) Long-time players cannot receive Kick-Off free rewards or free drafts. Why is this the case?  Solution: Old users must always be allowed to claim the new Kick-Off rewards for free.  7) There are no high OVR goalkeepers available in the draft.  Solution: Include high OVR goalkeepers in the draft.  8) There are very few sources to obtain drafts in the game (Not enough ways to get drafts).  Solution: Increase the number of draft sources, and make drafts easier to obtain (rewards, gifts, and daily rewards...).  “Draft System – Evil Larry Rating: 5/10 (Poor performance, needs major improvements, not good for F2P users).   What do you think? Is anything missing? Give your rating for the new Draft System!  This feedback focuses on the Draft System only. Part 2 with more insights is coming soon—stay tuned!  - can you flag this with the developers?",Evil_Larry26,Seasoned Veteran,2026-01-21T03:47:00,5 hours ago,FC Mobile General Discussion,381,12,15

Regarding Server Issues in Turkey and the Balkans,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/regarding-server-issues-in-turkey-and-the-balkans/13074565,"Hello everyone and the EA Team,  For years, we have been investing both our time and financial resources into this game. However, the quality of service we receive in return unfortunately declines with each passing year.  The Problem Is No Longer About ""Internet Speed!""    Personally, I have a 1000 Mbps fiber infrastructure at my home. Even though I live in the heart of Istanbul and am geographically not that far from European servers, my in-game experience is a total disappointment. The problem is not our internet; it is EA's lack of investment in this region.  Chronic Issues We Face:   Heavy Gameplay (Input Delay): No matter how fast our internet is, the players feel heavy, as if they are ""moving through mud."" The response times are so poor that we end up fighting the game itself rather than the opponent.  Connection Instability: We receive ""unstable connection"" warnings most of the week. Disconnections or freezes in the middle of a match have become a routine. Even without the warning, the game is far from the fluidity it should have. Maybe only one day a week is the game truly ""playable.""  Unfair Competition: While players close to server hubs (Germany, Netherlands, etc.) play with 1-5 ms, we try to play between 20-30 ms (which is often a dream anyway) with poor-quality data flow. Under these conditions, it is impossible to talk about fair competition in competitive modes.   I’ve reached a point where, instead of asking myself ""Do I feel like playing FC today?"", I ask ""I wonder if the servers are good today?"" Please show some value to such a loyal player base.  Our Expectations and Solution Proposals for EA Sports:  Increasing server capacity for the Balkans/Turkey line or planning a new Local Server Hub that can handle the high player density in this region.  Optimizing the data routing between current servers and this region to prevent data loss and ""heavy gameplay"" (delay), even when ping values appear low.

Inconsistent Gameplay/Opponents,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-ultimate-team-en/inconsistent-gameplayopponents/13118527,"Every time I score an early goal, it's like EA uses an invisible hand to give my opponent a boost.  My players can no longer control the ball. I pass using ""X"" with very little power. Yet somehow the pass receiver, who is not under any immediate pressure, mis controls the ball as it bounces away from him. In the time that it takes for him to reach the ball and control it with 2-3 touches, my opponent has closed the distance. It feels like his player has Anticipate+. He tackles, steals the ball, and it's magically at his feet and under his control with one touch.  When my CBs poke the ball away, it always falls to his teammate.  After scoring early, my strikers refuse to shoot in a timely manner. When they do, nearly ever shot with Finesse+ hits the bar or is catching practice for the GK. This continues until my opponent scores at least 1 goal. What's strange is my 2nd goal comes from a more difficult opportunity than the earlier misses. It also feels like his CBs have been given Jockey+ as they are able to instantly change direction and block my shots.  It's not until the final final 10 minutes left that EA decides to take the chains off and lets both players run free.  I mostly notice it when it happens to me, but I have seen this happen to my opponents as well. He was winning 3-5 and then he missed an easy 1v1 that would have made it 3-6.  EA is rigging the gameplay to keep the scores within a ""competitive"" range.  I hate coming here to complain. I don't like sounding like a sore loser. But I can't help feel like there are elements out of my control.  What is causing this? Could my opponents tactics affect my player's ball control and overall performance? I've noticed it most when I have a narrow lead late in the game and it feels like my opponent is playing team press with a high back line.

Ultimate Gauntlet – Frequent “Connection Lost” Disconnects (Server-Side Issue),https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/ultimate-gauntlet-%E2%80%93-frequent-%E2%80%9Cconnection-lost%E2%80%9D-disconnects-server-side-issue/13043672,"Hi, I occasionally experience the message “Connection to your opponent has been lost. We will review the match report and update you.”, and I’m trying to understand why this happens.  However, I want to emphasize that this issue occurs almost every time I play Ultimate Gauntlet, and the behavior is highly consistent. In other online modes, this rarely happens or does not happen at all. In Ultimate Gauntlet specifically, the disconnect occurs very predictably.  In most cases, the disconnect happens around 10–15 minutes into the match (typically around the 12-minute mark). Once the match reaches that point, the disconnect feels almost guaranteed, regardless of the score or gameplay situation. This strongly suggests a time-based or server-side instability tied specifically to Ultimate Gauntlet, rather than random network issues or player behavior.  When the disconnect occurs, the system displays the message indicating that the match report will be reviewed, and the final result becomes inconsistent and unclear. This behavior has been observed repeatedly under the same conditions, making it feel systematic rather than accidental.  My connection should not be the issue. I’m using a CAT6 Ethernet cable, a stable 500 Mbps wired connection, and no background applications were running (screenshot attached). I do not use any third-party tools, overlays, or software, and my PC setup is clean. I’m running an NVIDIA RTX 5070 GPU, and everything on my side remains stable throughout the match.  The only consistent technical indicator I’ve noticed is that the in-game ping suddenly spikes shortly before the disconnect. This spike happens most frequently — and almost exclusively — in Ultimate Gauntlet matches, again pointing toward a server or matchmaking issue rather than a local connection problem.  At this point, my main goal is simply to understand why Ultimate Gauntlet in particular is so prone to this issue, and whether there are any steps players can take to avoid it. If this is caused by server instability rather than intentional quits, I genuinely hope EA can improve the stability of Ultimate Gauntlet — especially for PC players, since these disconnections directly affect competitive outcomes.  Because this issue occurs repeatedly, predictably, and at a similar time into the match, it may be reproducible on the server side. I’m sharing this in good faith so EA can investigate any potential instability specific to Ultimate Gauntlet and address it properly.",DetroitYasu,Seasoned Newcomer,2026-01-21T01:21:00,8 hours ago,FC 26 Technical Issues,86,0,1

I’m not trying to argue the rules or ask for special treatment. I’m simply asking for forgiveness and a second chance, as this mistake doesn’t reflect how I normally play the game.

This problem occurs randomly despite my controller being fully compatible and properly connected to my PC via a stable USB connection. I have reached a point of extreme frustration because sometimes the game functions correctly, but other times it switches to keyboard input without any changes being made to my hardware setup. To troubleshoot, I have gone as far as completely unplugging my keyboard and mouse before launching the game, yet the system still defaults to keyboard controls. Every time I am forced to leave a match because of this glitch, the game gives me a DNF warning and penalizes my account progress. It is incredibly unfair to be punished for leaving a game when the software itself is making the match unplayable by disabling my primary input device. I have verified that my controller works perfectly in other applications, so the conflict is clearly within the FC 26 software environment. I need a permanent solution that ensures my controller is recognized as the primary device every single time I boot up the game. I am tired of losing matches and receiving warnings for a hardware detection error that is entirely out of my control. Please look into this input priority bug and let me know how I can lock my settings to controller only.

This downgrade feels deliberate. Defensive AI has been intentionally weakened to favor professional players, streamers, and high-paced offensive gameplay. Defenders now behave irrationally, leave massive gaps without reason, fail to mark attackers, and react far too late. This is not “skill gap” — it is forced incompetence. These changes do not reward tactical defending, positioning, or anticipation. Instead, they manufacture mistakes in the defensive AI to increase goal frequency and make attacking easier for a small, vocal group of competitive players. The result is an unbalanced and frustrating experience for the majority of the player base. If gameplay decisions are being driven primarily by feedback from professionals and content creators, then the core football experience is being sacrificed. A football game should reward intelligence and discipline, not artificially created defensive errors. This update has reduced realism, balance, and player control.

Account Details:    EA/Origin ID: [edit: email address removed]  Platform: PlayStation 5  Geographic Region: Egypt    Detailed Description of the Issue:   The core issue is two-fold: limited access and in-game disconnection/loss counting.   Access Difficulty: It takes me over two hours of repeated attempts to successfully log into the Ultimate Team mode.  In-Game Disconnects: Once I finally manage to enter FUT, I am consistently disconnected after playing a maximum of one or two matches.  Match Result Error: Crucially, all matches from which I am disconnected (regardless of whether I was winning or drawing) are registered as a Loss on my record.  Problem Duration: This frustrating situation has been ongoing since the game's release.    Comparison with Other Modes:   I would like to emphasize that the game's Seasons mode and other non-FUT online modes work perfectly with no connection issues, indicating the problem is specifically localized to my Ultimate Team access and connection stability.   Troubleshooting Steps Already Taken:   I have already attempted the following standard troubleshooting steps, but the problem persists:   Restarted the game and console multiple times.  Verified my internet connection (stable connection confirmed).  Cleared the console cache.  Reinstalled the entire game ([Mention if you have done this, otherwise delete this line]).

FC26 Player Career Error,https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/fc26-player-career-error/13117776,"FC26 Player Career Error The “Highlights” feature in FC 26’s Player Career mode is completely broken. This issue previously existed in FC 25 and was not fixed. When entering highlights, the game should pass the ball to me, but instead it's scattered to random players, out of bounds, or even across the field. Pass management is uncontrolled, targeting is incorrect, and the logic is completely broken. The ball doesn't reach me, attacks become useless, and therefore the mode becomes unplayable. This is not a user error this is directly due to a malfunction in the working logic of the Highlight Engine. The same problems are encountered repeatedly. The problem is 100% repeatable. It is unacceptable that this mode has been brought to this state. The fact that such an obvious error has not been fixed for months also shows a serious lack of quality control. Please don't dismiss this error with ""we'll look into it later."" Even your game currency and basic pass targeting don't malfunction.  My expectations: – Review of the Highlight Manager/Pass Targeting system – Fix for pass exchange – Immediate components for the bug preventing the ball from going towards the player – Review of Browser/Animation Assistant data – Official inclusion of this bug in the Patch Notes I also have data available to address the bugs and fix them quickly",qac67185ef30,New Spectator,2026-01-20T18:32:00,15 hours ago,FC 26 Bug Reports,6,0,0

Has the New Tactical System Failed?,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/has-the-new-tactical-system-failed/13100387,"Has the New Tactical System Failed?    The ""Sterile"" System: Why Flexibility Was Lost :    The new tactical system, originally introduced in FC 25, feels rigid and restrictive compared to the fluidity we enjoyed in the past. Unlike the legacy system, which offered players freedom based on manual instructions, the current engine is built entirely around ""Player Roles."" In my opinion, this concept has fundamentally failed to deliver a realistic experience.    This system is based on the concept of Roles, which dictates player movements. I consider this a failure because if it were successful, we wouldn't find Evolutions granting Roles +/++ to players cards in their preferred position, allowing the player (myself) to use the cards in their preferred position. It's illogical for a player to be unable to play their preferred position in the first place.      It is illogical for a player to be fundamentally incompetent in their preferred position until an Role + / ++ ""unlocks"" their ability to perform there.  In the old system, players had the freedom to move within their positions based on the custom instructions we gave them, without these arbitrary restrictions. It was intuitive: if a player is in their preferred position, they should naturally be able to execute standard instructions.  The Logical Inconsistency of Dual Positions :    Another glaring issue appears with players who hold alternate positions ,such as RW and LW. These positions often share identical Roles, such as the ""Inside Forward."" It is structurally illogical for a player to excel with a Role+ or Role++ on the right wing, yet lack that same proficiency on the left, given that the tactical instructions for the role are exactly the same.  The only variable that should realistically impact a player's performance when switching flanks is their Weak Foot ability, not an arbitrary reduction in Role proficiency.  For example Phil Foden’s Gold card. His card Have both RW and LW as playable positions. However, he possesses the Inside Forward+ role when deployed at RW, yet inexplicably loses that ""Role +"" status when moving to LW. This creates an artificial limitation that defies football logic.      The ""With & Without"" Dilemma :    There is also a distinct flaw in the system regarding player instructions: the game forces a unified set of behaviors for both 'With Ball' and 'Without Ball' scenarios. Currently, these cannot be modified separately, which is fundamentally illogical.    Football is dynamic; a player’s duties during possession often differ drastically from their responsibilities when making off-the-ball runs or transitioning to defense. By coupling these instructions together, the game removes a layer of tactical depth. It is essential to have the option to customize these two distinct phases of play independently, rather than being locked into a one-dimensional setting.      Inconsistent Defensive Spacing :    I also noticed a baffling tactical anomaly regarding the positioning of Center Backs. When switching between different formations, the physical distance between the two CBs varies significantly without any logical explanation.  Tactically speaking, any formation utilizing a standard back-four should maintain consistent spacing across the defensive line. The structural integrity of the defense should not fluctuate based on the midfield setup. Yet, comparing a 4-4-2 to a 4-2-2-2, for example, reveals noticeable discrepancies in the gap between the center-backs. This arbitrary variance disrupts the defensive shape and feels disconnected from real-world football tactics, where the backline usually operates as a cohesive, fixed unit regardless of the formation ahead of them.      The Absence of Depth and Width Sliders :    The removal of manual control over Depth and Width severely handicaps your tactical potential on the pitch. This limitation was glaringly obvious at the game’s launch, where a critical defensive issue existed: the excessive spacing between the two Center Backs.  This gap was clearly visible even in the tactics menu, yet players were powerless to fix it. We were forced to wait an extended period for a Title Update to finally rectify the problem. The frustration lies in the fact that this entire ordeal could have been easily avoided; had the Width slider still been available, players could have instantly tightened the defensive shape themselves, mitigating the issue without needing to wait for a developer patch.    we need the ability to manually adjust Depth and Width restored, mirroring the flexibility of the old system. If the developers are hesitant to simply bring back the old sliders, then they must innovate a new mechanism that achieves the same result      The Diminished Impact of Substitutes :    Currently, substitutes have become significantly less influential, particularly when deployed in positions that are not their exact primary match. For example, bringing a Right Winger (RW) on as a Right Midfielder (RM) or a Striker (ST) results in a drastic and illogical drop in performance.    The fundamental purpose of a substitute is to provide a spark and change the momentum of the match. The game mechanics should reflect this intent. While I am not suggesting that an out-of-position substitute should perform with the same 100% efficiency or ""Role++"" mastery as they would in their natural spot, they must at least be competent.    The current mechanism needs an overhaul. A substitute should offer a baseline level of utility and impact simply by virtue of fresh energy and stats, rather than being rendered virtually useless just because they are slightly out of position.

Why FC 26 Must Fix Ultimate Team's Rating Chaos,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/why-fc-26-must-fix-ultimate-teams-rating-chaos/13116912,"Why FC 26 Must Fix Ultimate Team's Rating Chaos ?    For years, the Ultimate Team community has engaged in the annual ritual of debating player ratings.  the conversation has shifted from minor disagreements to a fundamental problem: the rating system is chaotic, arbitrary, and lacks a clear foundation.  Currently, the numbers on a card often feel meaningless.  The system is massively chaotic and does not rely on any clear criteria, which has directly caused numerous exploits in the game. It is imperative to establish a clear, fixed standard for the rating system.""    Examples:  Two Gold Cards ""Mapi León"" 89 Rating and ""van Dijk"" 90 Rating    To illustrate this absurdity, consider the comparison between Mapi León (89 OVR) and Virgil van Dijk (90 OVR). Both play in the exact same position: (CB). Yet, the data tells a conflicting story.   Mapi León Have 2294 In-Game Stats (IGS) and 470 Base Stats, whereas van Dijk sits at only 2,132 IGS and 454 Base Stats. How is it logically possible for an 89-rated card to significantly outperform a 90-rated card in raw attributes when they share the same Position?      ""Vitinha"" 89 Rating and ""Gullit"" 90 Rating  let’s examine the misleading gap between a Vitinha Gold card (89 OVR) and the Icon Ruud Gullit (90 OVR). Both are Central Midfielders (CM). Vitinha records 2,296 In-Game Stats and 476 Base Stats. Meanwhile, Gullit dominates with a massive 2,488 In-Game Stats and 514 Base Stats. On paper, the difference is merely a single OVR, yet the gap in internal attributes and actual pitch performance is astronomical. To fix this, EA must widen the gap: either by drastically lowering the rating curve for Gold cards, or by uncapping Icon ratings to realistically reflect their statistical superiority.""        ""van Dijk"" 90 Rating Gold Card and ""van Dijk"" 90 Rating FOFC Card    Further compounding this issue is an even more baffling comparison involving the same player: Virgil van Dijk. His standard Gold Card (90 OVR) comes with 2,132 In-Game Stats and 454 Base Stats. In contrast, his FOFC Card—which carries the exact same 90 OVR—boasts 2,219 In-Game Stats and 469 Base Stats. This raises a critical question: How can two versions of the same player share the identical face rating when one is statistically superior to the other in every measurable way?      This systemic failure has birthed a massive loophole within the 'Evolutions' mechanic. Because In-Game Stats and Base Stats do not correctly translate into the Overall Rating, players can exploit 'Evo Chains' to turn obscure Bronze cards into end-game monsters. These cards often bypass strict rating caps because their face rating remains artificially low, yet their internal performance surpasses the best cards in the game. The OVR system fails to act as a proper gatekeeper, allowing these statistical anomalies to break the game's intended power curve completely.  Example :      To drive the final nail in the coffin, consider this market-breaking comparison:  a 95-rated TOTY Vitinha versus an 82-rated Evolved Gullit. Both operate as CMs. The 95-rated Vitinha holds 2,534 In-Game Stats and 532 Base Stats. Shockingly, the humble 82-rated Gullit eclipses him with a massive 2,586 In-Game Stats and 528 Base Stats. This leads to the ultimate question: Why should any player grind for a TOTY Vitinha or spend millions on a Prime Icon when a free, low-rated card is statistically superior? This anomaly doesn't just confuse players; it destroys the transfer market, devalues rare items, and kills the longevity of the game cycle.""",elsahy22,Rising Adventurer,2026-01-20T12:03:00,21 hours ago,FC 26 Feedback & Suggestions,4,0,0

Baggio Evo +Time Warp feel noticeably less responsive than Base.,https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/baggio-evo-time-warp-feel-noticeably-less-responsive-than-base-/13093952,"Im reporting a potential gameplay issue affecting the newer Roberto Baggio cards, including TimeWarp and Silver Star Icon.  My evolved Baggio SS has 89+ in every dribbling-related stat, and with a chemistry style applied reaches 95+ agility and dribbling. Despite this, he feels noticeably less responsive during left-stick (jog) dribbling than the Base Icon Roberto Baggio, even when the Base version is on 0 chemistry. The same is true for the Time Warp SBC card which is frustrating as I spent coins on the SBC.  This behaviour includes:   Delayed or muted directional response during simple left-stick movement  Heavier movement than expected relative to attributes  Occasional loss of close control during basic dribbling   Given the significant attribute advantage on the evolved and special versions, this difference is very noticeable in direct comparison and does not appear to align with player stats.  For context, this behaviour feels similar to a previously acknowledged issue affecting Linda Caicedo, where certain player versions showed inconsistent close control and responsiveness despite strong dribbling attributes. That issue was later identified as a gameplay problem rather than an attribute or balance matter.  This report is not intended as a request for a buff or balance change. The Base Icon performs as expected, while the newer versions appear to behave differently, which suggests a potential animation, motion, or responsiveness issue affecting these cards specifically.  I’m confident this will be apparent when comparing the Base Icon to the evolved or special versions in similar gameplay situations. I’m happy to provide clips or further details.  have attached photos of others mentioning this.",Hhandsfour,Seasoned Rookie,2026-01-20T11:46:00,21 hours ago,FC 26 Bug Reports,44,0,1

Player career CDM glitch,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/player-career-cdm-glitch/13116719,"I would actually appreciate if you all could prioritize this as a hotfix.     There has always been a weird glitch where if you were a CDM and went to a new club or were playing on international duty that if the new club did not have a CDM position you defaulted to a defender and then had to go switch your position to a regular midfielder for your international spell.    You fixed this for the new club issue in the game where when you sign a new contract you have to pick your position, but it's fully broken for international duty in the case where your pro club is running a 4-2-3-1. If you are in a 4-3-3 for your pro club you are still able to swap positions in editing your player and you are fine then as a LM or RM. However, if your pro club is a 4-2-3-1 then you can only switch between RDM and LDM and so you are basically stuck playing as a defender for your national team. It's not a great experience and I would say that it is also a fairly antiquated view of how CDM's play in modern football and who they positionally switch most often with.    Ideally you'd just fix it so a CDM would default as a midfielder not a defender, but you could also address the specific issue by allowing you to edit your player's position in a 4-2-3-1 to be any of the midfield roles.",rbowron1856,New Rookie,2026-01-20T10:53:00,22 hours ago,FC 26 Feedback & Suggestions,15,0,0

Persistent Disconnect Issues on PS5 Preventing Game Completion,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/persistent-disconnect-issues-on-ps5-preventing-game-completion/13037051,"I’m writing to report a severe and ongoing issue with disconnects on my PS5 that’s making it impossible for me to play or complete any games. This has been happening almost every single match for the past three weeks, and it’s incredibly frustrating as it’s completely ruining my experience.      I’m on PS5 and keep getting disconnected mid-game, which prevents me from finishing any session. This occurs consistently, no matter the time of day or game mode. As a result, I’ve been unable to make any progress, and it’s directly impacting the value I’ve gotten from my purchases.  I’ve exhausted all the common fixes I could find online and from support articles, but nothing has resolved the problem:   Cleared the cache in safe mode.  Completely reinstalled the game (multiple times).  Changed DNS settings to various public options (e.g., Google DNS).  Restarted my PS5 and modem/router numerous times.  Contacted my local internet provider, who confirmed no issues on their end (stable connection, no outages or throttling).   Additional Details:   Network Type: NAT Type 2  Connection: Wired via Ethernet cable (not Wi-Fi)  This has persisted for nearly 3 weeks without improvement.   Given that I’ve invested in the season pass and can’t use it due to these disconnects, I’d like to request a full refund for what I’ve spent on it. I love the game when it works, but at this point, it’s unplayable for me.  I’d appreciate it if the tech team could look into this—maybe it’s a server-side issue or something specific to PS5 users? Any advice or updates would be helpful, but a refund would go a long way toward making this right.",Minki_TMC,Seasoned Newcomer,2026-01-20T07:41:00,1 day ago,FC 26 Technical Issues,338,1,9

Our requests are as follows:  We want a Bangladesh server, so that players from Bangladesh can play online matches without lag, and the game is equally accessible for everyone.  We want online tournaments with 32 teams, making competitions more challenging and exciting. This will strengthen the game community and encourage more players to participate.  We want voice chat in online matches, so that players can communicate with each other and coordinate strategies effectively. We want accounts to have their voice chat feature locked if a player uses offensive language or insults others. Repeated offenses should result in a permanent voice chat lock on the account.  We want player Overall (Over) not to exceed 100. If a player’s Overall exceeds 100, it should display as Max, indicating that the account has reached the maximum. However, players should have to put in effort to reach this Max. This is important to us because if many players have Over 120 while our Over is 105, it creates an unfair experience. Proper balance ensures fair play; for example, if my Over is 90 and another player’s Over is 100, the game feels fair and enjoyable.  We want if a player leaves a match midway, they receive a warning. Repeated offenses should result in the account being banned, and players should be able to appeal in case of network issues, ensuring fairness for all players.  We want Typekeeper and extra time features, because currently when a 90-minute match ends in a draw, the match finishes with no extra time or Typekeeper provided. We want matches to continue with extra time and Typekeeper enabled so players can complete the match, preserving the true excitement, competition, and realism of the game.  We want a Coach feature, allowing players to follow coach instructions on the field. This will add realism to the game and improve team strategy.  We have observed that many pillars’ Overall (Over) reach up to 119, which disrupts game balance and enjoyment. We want pillars’ Overall not to exceed 100. This ensures fair and balanced gameplay. Players should need to put in effort to reach the Max, maintaining the challenge of the game.  We believe implementing these updates will make the game more fun, fair, community-friendly, and enjoyable. Implementing these features will also enhance FC Mobile's popularity and improve the overall player experience.  We would also suggest that developers consider adding additional realistic features or rules to further enhance the game’s realism and competitive experience.",9vvgidpvz7hx,Seasoned Newcomer,2026-01-20T07:26:00,1 day ago,FC Mobile Bug Reports,40,0,4

My main problem is with the pack and challenge rewards system. I have spent a significant amount of coins collecting packs from the in-game store—specifically, two packs costing 200,000 and 250,000 coins, totaling 450,000 coins.     Despite this, every pack I open contains only gold players. Similarly, I complete a very large number of challenges (SBCs and other objectives), but the rewards are the same—only gold players, with no new, high-rated, or valuable players. This has been extremely frustrating because I invested a lot of time and effort into the game expecting to receive competitive and useful players, but I have not benefited at all.     I have contacted EA support multiple times. They confirmed that there is no issue with my account and suggested that the problem may be server-related. While I appreciate their efforts to report the issue to the backend team, I have not received any compensation or solution so far. In most games, players are usually compensated when server or system-related problems prevent them from receiving fair rewards. In this case, I feel that I have lost both time and coins, and I now regret purchasing the game.     Collecting 450,000 coins was very time-consuming, and I hoped to get high-value players that I could use or trade to earn more coins. My request is simple: I am asking for a refund of the 450,000 coins I spent, or another fair solution to this issue. I would also like clarification on whether the resolution will be a technical fix in the game or compensation for the coins I spent.

[Bug] Unable to Renew Player Contracts in Career Mode,https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/bug-unable-to-renew-player-contracts-in-career-mode/12600963,"Hello, 
 I would like to report a bug I encountered in EA FC 26 Career Mode (Manager). 
 Issue: 
 I am unable to renew the contract of a player who is already in my club, no matter how many times I try. 
 Details: 
 
 The issue occurs both when starting a brand-new career and when continuing into later seasons (e.g., 5th year). 
 After some time, players end up leaving the club for very low transfer fees, even if I don’t accept it. This completely breaks the career experience. 
 I recorded a video as an example and attached it here. 
 Platform: [PlayStation] 
 Game version: 
 
 Expected Behavior: 
 I should be able to renew contracts with players in my squad and keep them unless I decide otherwise. 
 Actual Behavior: 
 The game does not allow me to renew contracts at all, and after some time, players leave for cheap transfer fees without my approval. 
 This issue makes Career Mode frustrating. Please fix this as soon as possible, otherwise buying early access feels pointless. 
 Thank you for your support and hard work! 
 Best regards, 
 Highlighting official EA response: 
 
 Thank you for all your reports. I've asked our Career Mode team about it, but they confirmed, this is working as intended. This has been a recent change in FC 26, where players in the last year of their contract will not be willing to renew their contract right away.    Instead, over time, depending on variables like morale and matches played, they can become willing to expand the contract.    We've actually highlighted that change in our Career Deep Dive. I'd recommend reading through it all to better understand the intricacies and new changes in FC 26.",NevzatMiracDemir,Seasoned Newcomer,2026-01-20T04:13:00,1 day ago,FC 26 Bug Reports,10000,109,179

Controller input freezing on PC,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/controller-input-freezing-on-pc/13105546,"Before the TOTYs on Thursday 15 the game was running with no problem for about 2 weeks.

This happens on Rush, Rivals, Squad Battles, EVEN IN MENUS. I've tested both controllers I own (both DS4s), and my keyboard, and their input still gets frozen or delayed like that. I've tried with other games and controller testing programs, but no, this only happens in this game.  It's literally unplayable, there's nothing that fixes this problem. Way to kill the TOTY hype, plus with these tight time constraints on objectives and evolutions, this has gotten really frustrating.  I have an option enabled ingame to show the inputs in a little controller on the upper right part of the screen, and yes, it's getting stuck, it's not even input delay (would be visible with a delay between white and green inputs), the buttons and joysticks simply don't respond for a few seconds out of nowhere.  It's insane that SINCE release I have only been able to play this game without game breaking problems for only 2 weeks.

Squad Management & Transfers Broken – Latest Update Made It Even Worse,https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/squad-management--transfers-broken-%E2%80%93-latest-update-made-it-even-worse/13097138,"At this point it’s hard to avoid stating the obvious: EA FC 26 is fundamentally broken at its core.  The single most essential feature of a football game — transfers and squad management — barely works anymore. Here’s what’s currently happening (and has been happening for months):  -Transfers do not save or revert randomly  -Tactical changes aren’t applied  -Players cannot be moved between positions reliably  -Editing too many squads leads to CE-108255-1, freezing the game entirely  -Managing multiple teams is basically a gamble rather than a feature  Instead of addressing any of this, the latest update actually made things worse: With the introduction of World Selection teams (or like legend teams...I don't know the proper english word, I'm from germany), the system now seems completely overwhelmed. Players who exist both in their club squad and World Selection are effectively locked.  Concrete example:  Cole Palmer and Moisés Caicedo (Chelsea)  -> Both are part of Chelsea and the ""Best of Chelsea""-team  -> Result: They cannot be transferred to any other club at all. Ever.  This is not a niche edge case — it directly affects real-world star players and makes long-term modes borderline unplayable. So here we are:  -A football game where transfers don’t work  -A management system that collapses under basic usage  -Each update adding features instead of fixing the foundation  And yes, it’s hard not to notice that anything not related to monetization seems to have zero priority. But maybe — just maybe — someone at EA might eventually want to fix the actual game.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Or are we just supposed to accept that squad management is now a decorative menu?  Thanks in advance.

Boot styles on Icons and Heroes don’t reflect their real-life type,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/boot-styles-on-icons-and-heroes-don%E2%80%99t-reflect-their-real-life-type/13090824,"Hello,  Icons and Heroes are currently appearing in modern sock-style boots and single block-colour boots in-game, which are not historically accurate for the vast majority of these players.  It appears that boot styles for Icons and Heroes are selected from a general rotation that includes these modern designs. While this works well for contemporary players, most Icons and Heroes played in eras where classic black leather boots, or subtle colour variations, were the standard. As a result, these modern boots feel out of place and reduce historical immersion.  If possible, it would be great to adjust this rotation so that modern sock boots and block-colour boots are excluded for Icons and Heroes, allowing them to default to more era-appropriate footwear. This seems like a relatively small presentation change, but one that would have a noticeable impact on authenticity.  To clearly show the issue, I’ve added three images:   The first shows an example of an ideal classic boot model on Maradona, which feels appropriate for his era.  The second shows modern sock boots appearing on Pelé, which do not align with the period he played in.  The third shows block-colour boots appearing on Völler, which similarly feel out of place for a historical player.      There are a small number of exceptions where modern or distinctive boots make sense (for example, all-white boots for Ronaldinho), but these cases are rare. For the vast majority of Icons and Heroes, classic boots would better reflect their real-life careers.  As a related visual reference, Bobby Charlton’s Icon consistently wears completely black classic boots in game, which appears to be an intentional choice to reflect the boots he wore during his playing career. Ideally every the option to actually customize their boots would be ideal but failing that, every icon having the classic style black or black + white laces/colour laces would be the next best thing.  The overall likeness and presentation quality for Icons and Heroes is excellent, which is why this detail stands out.

Banning on PC continues and no statement so far!,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-ultimate-team-en/banning-on-pc-continues-and-no-statement-so-far/13114870,"PLEASE IF YOU SEE THIS AT LEAST ISSUE A STATEMENT THAT EA ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND IS INVESTIGATING IT!   Hello everyone,  I wanted to share my experience and provide some feedback regarding recent Transfer Market bans on PC during the Team of the Year period.  My account received a Transfer Market ban for “coin distribution,” even though I have never bought or sold coins, never transferred coins between accounts, and never used any third-party tools or automation. All activity was done manually on a single account.  For context, my trading mainly took place during the start of TOTY, roughly between 19:00 and 01:00. I was trading commonly used SBC fodder in the 85–89 rating range (for example Hegerberg, Schüller or De Bruyne), bidding slightly below the current market price and reselling shortly after at market-consistent prices due to high SBC demand.  At peak times I had around 50–60 unassigned items, but I reduced this again and by the end of the evening / the following morning there were no unassigned items left. My coin balance fluctuated during the session (roughly from 2.0m down to 1.5m and back to around 1.9m from sales). A lot of value is currently tied up in my club, transfer list, transfer targets and SBC storage, which would result in additional coins once sold.  I also did some normal flipping and sniping, including special cards (for example Time-Wrapped Carvajal, Joga Bonito Murillo, Thunderstruck Çalhanoğlu) and TOTW cards close to discard value. Especially during TOTY, TOTWs drop heavily with supply and later rise again due to SBC requirements, which is a common and expected market pattern.  In my opinion the most hilarious point:  On the same day, I also purchased FC Points for 50€ to open packs. Not something a coin seller (or buyer) would do.   I did receive a few short soft bans for searching and filtering too frequently (for example when trying to snipe In-Forms or before certain price ranges were adjusted), but no warnings or restrictions beyond that until the Transfer Market ban.  TOTY is an extremely volatile time, especially on PC and Web App, with very high trading volume and rapid price movements. From what I’m seeing in the community, multiple PC players appear to be affected by similar bans despite engaging in normal trading behavior. This raises the concern that legitimate high-volume trading during major events may sometimes trigger false positives.  I fully support actions against coin selling. At the same time, I would really appreciate it if someone could take a closer look at my case (and similiar ones) to confirm whether the activity truly falls outside the rules, or whether the event context and market conditions played a role.  I’m posting this as feedback in the hope that it helps improve the system and avoids legitimate players being caught unintentionally.",Sharpedge1999,Seasoned Novice,2026-01-20T00:55:00,1 day ago,EA SPORTS FC™ 26 Ultimate Team,31,0,0

After I cleared the FC Mobile app data and logged back in:  Both EA Accounts were incorrectly linked to only one game account  My main account became inaccessible  I did NOT press overwrite or confirm replacing any progress  The missing account is still visible in the game, which means the data clearly still exists  This is clearly a system or linking error, not something I intentionally caused.  💸 Real Money Lost  What makes this unacceptable is that:  I spent real money on this game  Purchases were made in good faith, trusting EA’s system  Now that account is inaccessible  I’m being told it “can’t be recovered” with no proper explanation  If a company takes players’ money, it should also take responsibility when its systems fail.  ❌ Poor Customer Service Experience  EA Support has been extremely disappointing:  Cases are constantly transferred between teams  Status keeps changing (waiting on player, update by customer, transferred)  I keep providing information, screenshots, and explanations  No one actually fixes the problem  I’m offered a one-time grant instead of restoring what I paid for  It honestly feels like EA only cares about taking money, not about helping players when something goes wrong.  ⚠️ Why This Is Not Acceptable  The account data still exists  No overwrite was done  No clear technical reason is given for why recovery is “impossible”  Players are left stuck while live events continue  This is not how a major company should treat paying customers.  ❓ What I Want  I want my original account restored  If that’s truly impossible, I want a clear, honest explanation  Not automated replies  Not endless transfers  Not being pushed toward compensation instead of a real fix  I’m posting here because EA Help has failed to resolve this properly.

Real issues with this game,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-game-modes-en/real-issues-with-this-game/13114690,"I've tried to give this game a chance but it doesn't feel the same as the prequels for the following reasons:    1: In UT, I faced a team with 80 CHEM on WC and I have 86 and throughout the whole match their passing was 100% and as for my team, it was a measly 80%  because the passing is so abysmal when it comes to no forward runs and a extremely slow defense when defending your goal from attacking players.  2: Career Mode gives you a MINUTE height choice which goes up ONLY to 6'2 but on older games it goes UP to 6'7 which made it a dream to be a defender or a GK, how are you supposed to challenge for a aerial battle if your CAW is only 6'2? And even on professional difficulty, IT IS SO EASY to score against the other team and all they ever do is pass after pass and they fluff their attempts at goal even on one / one against the goalkeeper.

FC 26 defensive AI is rubbish,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/fc-26-defensive-ai-is-rubbish/12714440,"Dear EA Team,  As a long-time fan of football video games, I am extremely disappointed with the release of FC26. This is by far the worst edition I have ever played, and honestly, the experience is terrible. The gameplay completely betrays the essence of football, especially with the unbalanced and unrealistic defensive AI, which destroys any sense of teamwork and makes individual dribbling far too easy. This seriously ruins the fun of the game.  The defensive players in FC26 simply back off without putting any real pressure on the attacker. They never try to make a real tackle or interception, so it’s almost effortless to get past the defense with simple ball control. This kind of design is far from real football and has greatly reduced the competitive and cooperative aspects that make these games enjoyable.  I hope you will listen to player feedback and urgently improve the defensive AI and team coordination to restore the real spirit of football to the game.

For the past three years, I have been playing FC 24, FC 25, and FC 26 exclusively on PC. Unfortunately, with FC 26, I am facing severe technical issues that I never encountered in the previous titles.  I purchased FC 26 two weeks ago. Although I have logged about 8-9 hours in the game, I have not been able to complete a single match without issues. The game is currently in an unplayable state due to a persistent 5 FPS lock and massive input delay.  Here are the specific details of the issue:  Inconsistent Performance: Sometimes, I can play the first match smoothly at 90 FPS. However, as soon as I exit and start a second match (or change modes), the frame rate instantly drops to 5 FPS and gets stuck there.  Resource Usage Anomaly: When this FPS drop occurs, my GPU usage hits 100%, yet the performance is non-existent. This strongly suggests a severe VRAM leak or an optimization failure within the game engine.  Randomness: The issue seems completely random but inevitable. It happens regardless of the game mode.  Troubleshooting Steps I Have Already Taken: I have tried every possible solution on my end, but nothing has fixed the issue:  Performed a completely clean installation of Windows 11.  Set my laptop and GPU to ""High Performance"" / ""Ultimate Performance"" modes.  Monitored hardware temperatures; thermals are completely normal and within safe limits.  Updated all drivers and BIOS to the latest versions.  Conclusion: I was able to play FC 24 and FC 25 at over 100 FPS flawlessly on this exact same system. This confirms that my hardware is fully capable and the problem lies entirely within FC 26's game files and optimization.  Currently, I feel like my money has been wasted as the product is defective. I have attached the necessary log files and screenshots below.  I urgently request a solution or an imminent patch update to fix this memory/performance bug. I cannot play the game I paid for.  Looking forward to a quick resolution.  Regards,",sinanbey74,Seasoned Novice,2026-01-19T16:19:00,1 day ago,FC 26 Technical Issues,1000,14,24

How EA can improve FC 26,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-ultimate-team-en/how-ea-can-improve-fc-26/13113984,"NUKE IT!  Just stop working on this game and dedicate the next 8 months to making FC 27 a game that delivers on the promises made in FC 26.  Start by dedicating more servers to fix the gameplay congestion issues that have been constant since FC 26's release. I'm playing TOTY 2 live event and my players feel like they are running in ankle deep water. Every touch is a knock-on dribble. The input delay makes it nearly impossible to score and the unstable connection is causing my players not to complete the right actions because it cuts out mid button combo (ridiculous that I need to press 3 buttons for 1 player action).  Stop manipulating the gameplay to handicap/tilt the scales in the CPU's favor. Or at least keep that in Ultimate difficulty. Casual gamers don't want to play against what feels like the same team wearing a different uniform over and over again. There is no room to explore different tactics.  Match players based on their actual rank and not where you think they should be. I'm tired of losing 2-3 games in a row and then getting placed against a bot/whipping boy. It's just not fun.  Originally I had planned on buying FC points before TOTY, but now I'm glad I didn't. All the packs with better guaranteed players are untradeable. Coincidence? Or EA's greed?  I would not buy FC 27 based on my experience with FC 26. At this point, I may refrain from purchasing ANY future EA game.

serious problems on nintendo,https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/serious-problems-on-nintendo/13069791,"Ever since this game was transferred to EA in 2024, the experience on Nintendo has been absolutely terrible, and it feels like the platform and its players have been completely abandoned, because every single time I try to report bugs or glitches through official channels, nothing ever comes of it, nobody responds, nobody follows up, and I am left with the same broken issues year after year with no explanation or support, which is beyond frustrating for someone who actually cares about the game and wants it to function properly; the most infuriating part is that these are not small, rare bugs that only affect me, but major, obvious glitches that many other Nintendo players also experience, yet EA continues to ignore them across multiple titles, including FC 24, FC 25, and now FC 26, which makes it feel like Nintendo users are second-class players who don’t matter at all; the first and biggest issue is the transfer market, which has been broken for three straight games now and still hasn’t been acknowledged or fixed, because whenever I search for players, for example rare gold players, the market sorting makes absolutely no sense and completely defeats the purpose of filtering by time remaining, as it will correctly show cards ending the quickest at first, which is how it is supposed to work, but the moment I skip a few pages deeper into the market, the entire system breaks, jumping from cards that are ending in around 30 seconds straight to cards ending in six hours, which is completely impossible and illogical, because there is no realistic scenario where you go only a handful of pages into a rare gold search and suddenly the quickest ending cards are hours away, as that means the market is not properly loading, sorting, or refreshing listings at all; this issue ruins sniping, trading, and even basic browsing of the market, and it makes the transfer market feel unusable compared to other platforms, yet despite this happening consistently in FC 24, FC 25, and FC 26, EA has done absolutely nothing about it, even though it is clearly broken and clearly not working as intended; the second major issue is with pack animations, which might sound cosmetic to some people but is actually a core part of the Ultimate Team experience, and on Nintendo it is completely scuffed and unfinished, because when you open packs, the animations either do not work properly or do not work at all, and this has been the case for multiple years now, as in FC 25 and FC 26 I have never once seen the double walkout animation function correctly, not a single time, even though it exists on other platforms and is supposed to trigger when you pack two high-rated players, but on Nintendo it simply never happens, which makes it feel like we are playing a downgraded or unfinished version of the game; on top of that, in FC 26 specifically, pack openings are completely stripped of their presentation, because instead of the proper animation where the pack opens, the flag appears, the position is revealed, and the player walks out like it does on PS5, Xbox, and PC, the Nintendo version just skips everything and shows the card instantly, whether it is a walkout or not, completely killing the excitement and immersion of opening packs and making it feel cheap and rushed; this is not a small visual bug, this is a fundamental part of how packs are supposed to work, and the fact that it has been broken for multiple titles shows a clear lack of care or testing for the Nintendo version; what makes all of this even worse is the complete lack of communication and support from EA, because every time I try to report these issues, I get ignored, no one responds to bug reports, no one provides updates, and live chat support is absolutely useless, as they either do not understand the problem, give generic copy-and-paste responses, or simply end the conversation without offering any real help or solution, which makes the whole support system feel like a joke; it is exhausting to constantly explain the same issues over and over again only to be met with silence, and it creates the feeling that EA simply does not care about fixing problems on Nintendo at all; at this point, it genuinely feels like the Nintendo version of the game is neglected, forgotten, and treated as an afterthought, despite the fact that people are still paying full price for it and spending time and money on Ultimate Team just like players on other platforms; I am sick and tired of asking for help and getting nothing back, sick and tired of dealing with the same broken systems across three different games, and sick and tired of being ignored when reporting clear, repeatable bugs that should never last this long in a properly supported game; all I want is for these issues to be acknowledged, fixed, and communicated properly, because right now the experience on Nintendo is unacceptable, unfair, and incredibly frustrating, and as a player who just wants the game to work as advertised, I want real help instead of silence, excuses, and neglect.",mattheww90210,Seasoned Newcomer,2026-01-19T12:20:00,1 day ago,FC 26 Bug Reports,40,1,1

This happens in two scenarios:  Mid-Match : The game drops instantly. There is no prior lag, speed-up lag, or warning indicators.  Menus/SBCs : I get disconnected while submitting SBCs or navigating menus.  Troubleshooting Done :       1.  Reset Router / Flushed DNS / Reset Winsock.       2. Updated Network Drivers.       3. ExitLag: Tried using ExitLag to optimize the route, but the disconnects persist.  The Diagnostic Clue (VPN Works) : I tested with NordVPN (Mumbai server). When the VPN is active, the disconnects STOP completely. However, this raises my ping to 80ms+, making the game unplayable.

As a 30-year veteran of the series who was ready to walk away last week, I can officially say: You fixed it.  The difference in gameplay integrity is night and day. Specifically:   Offensive Responsiveness: The ""Mud"" is gone. Left-stick dribbling and transition play feel dynamic and 1:1 with my inputs again.  Defensive Integrity: Thank you for restoring the Manual Interception hitboxes. My defenders actually feel like solid objects again. When I read a lane surgically, I am rewarded with the ball instead of it phasing through my player's legs.  Goalkeeper Logic: The ""Bi-line Trickle"" goals seem to be addressed. Keepers are making logical, physical blocks rather than getting stuck in frozen animations.   I have no immediate recommendations for changes—this build feels like the best the game has been all year - and maybe since 2013 and 2017 games. I’ll be testing this against the AI in Seasons/Career to ensure the logic translates across all modes, but for now, please keep the gameplay exactly where it is.

The game keeps showing “New input detected” and locks into “Keyboard + Mouse” mode, even when no mouse is connected.  This issue did **not** exist at launch and appeared out of nowhere without updates.    It seems EA is pulling input preferences from the cloud or user profile, forcing an incorrect input mode.

This game's issues are infinite,https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/this-games-issues-are-infinite/13112986,Its honestly mindboggling how many bugs exist in a single game especially on PC. This game desperately needs a major patch that actually reworks this whole mess. You launch the game and your FPS drops to 5 or 10 until you go into a normal match leave it then jump into Rush play a bit at 5 FPS leave again and only then its fixed. You have to do this every single time you start the game which is an absolute waste of time just to be able to play. Then once youre finally in the problems continue. Ultimate Team menu bugs that dont show rewards or objectives rewards not counting randomly getting kicked out of Ultimate Team. You log back in play for two to three hours and then the FPS drop bug starts again. So you leave Ultimate Team go to normal modes again to unlock your FPS like a clown and repeat the whole circus. At this point its 30 percent gameplay and 70 percent trying to fix a game I paid over 90 dollars for which is insane. What makes it worse is the patch speed and the completely useless fixes being pushed. I dont mind a game launching with issues that happens but its been over four months and there has not been a single impactful patch only updates that somehow always manage to generate more money. What the hell is going on how can you act like everything is fine when you know players are having one of the worst gaming experiences of their lives. At least do something try to fix it.

This happens randomly during matches, and it ruins the gameplay — especially in VS Attack or Head-to-Head where quick reactions matter most.

Issue Summary:  Ghost touch / unintended input occurs during the first Rank H2H match after launching the game.     Device Information:     - Device: Nubia Neo GT 5G  - OS Version: Android 15  - Display: 120Hz (tested also at 60Hz)     Game Information:     - Game: EA SPORTS FC Mobile  - Game Version: 26.1.02  - Mode affected: Rank H2H (Head-to-Head)  - Occurrence: First match only (leg pertama)     Detailed Description:  After launching the game and entering Rank H2H for the first time, the match often experiences unintended touch inputs such as:     - Players moving without joystick input  - Sprint, pass, or shot triggering without being pressed  - Joystick direction drifting or snapping unexpectedly     This issue consistently happens only in the first H2H match after opening the app.  From the second match onward, controls behave normally and the issue does not recur unless the game is restarted.     Additional Observations:     - The issue does NOT occur in:     - VS AI     - Events     - Skill games     - Other mobile games  - Lowering refresh rate to 60Hz and disabling game booster features reduces the frequency but does not fully eliminate the issue.  - The issue appears related to initial online input synchronization at the start of the first H2H session.     Expected Result:  Touch input should be stable and accurate from the first H2H match onward, without unintended or automatic actions.     Actual Result:  Unintended touch inputs occur only during the first H2H match, affecting gameplay and match fairness.     I believe this may be a software-related input synchronization issue rather than a hardware problem, especially since it resolves itself after the first match.     Thank you for your attention. I hope this report helps improve stability in future updates.     Kind regards,  [LV•AslaM.]",ko8j6biwa9am,Newcomer,2026-01-19T08:03:00,2 days ago,FC Mobile Bug Reports,11,0,0

Scottish League overhaul!,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/scottish-league-overhaul/12709135,"Hi EA team,  Firstly, I want to thank you for finally adding Celtic Park and Ibrox Stadium — it’s great to finally see Scottish football getting proper recognition. However, there are still a few major issues that really need attention to make the Scottish Premiership feel authentic:  1. Unrealistic Crowd Chants (especially Celtic Park)  In-game, Celtic fans sing “You’ll Never Walk Alone” for the entire 90 minutes, which doesn’t happen in real life.  That song is sung before kickoff and occasionally before big matches or after major moments — not non-stop.  Please update the crowd audio logic so that “YNWA” only plays pre-match, and include real Celtic chants like “Celtic Symphony,” “Come On You Bhoys in Green,” and “The Fields of Athenry.”  Likewise, Rangers at Ibrox should have their own authentic songs like “Follow Follow” and “Simply the Best,” rather than generic loops.    2. Missing Scottish Stadiums  The SPFL partnership is great, but it’s disappointing that only two Scottish stadiums are currently in the game.  Please consider scanning and adding Hampden Park, Tynecastle Park, Easter Road, Pittodrie, and others in future updates.  Hampden, as the national stadium, especially deserves inclusion given its historic status and role in Euro 2028.    3. Broader SPFL Representation  The SPFL partnership should be reflected with more realistic crowd atmospheres, proper broadcast presentation, and updated stadium designs for all top-flight clubs.  Many of us would love to see more accurate kits, banners, fan TIFOs, and audio atmosphere that captures what makes Scottish football unique.    I know scanning and licensing takes time, but Scottish fans have waited years for this. The inclusion of Celtic Park and Ibrox was a great start — now it’s time to bring the rest of Scottish football up to the same standard as other major leagues.      4. Please also add in the other divisions also so at least other teams come up when promoted and relegated least it would serve a purpose to doing a better career within the Scottish game. And also add the league Cup also instead of just having the Scottish Cup.

I’m experiencing a serious performance issue in EA FC 26 Ultimate Team.  What happens:  -I launch the game and enter Ultimate Team  -For the first ~30 minutes everything is perfectly fine  -The first Rivals match runs without any issues  In the second match:  -First half is completely fine  -Second half becomes unplayable: extreme lag and massive FPS drops  -It feels like 1 frame per second, constant stuttering and screen jumping  Important details:  I haven’t found a permanent solution  Restarting the game fixes it, but only for another ~30 minutes  After restarting, the exact same cycle repeats  EA Support only suggested basic troubleshooting, which did not help  At this point, restarting the game is the only temporary fix, but it’s obviously not a real solution.

Hacker in fut champions (Player lock),https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/hacker-in-fut-champions-player-lock/12922797,"Hello EA Team,  I am requesting an official statement regarding a recurring issue in FUT Champions on PC that is making the mode extremely frustrating.  As soon as I reach a strong record in FUT Champions – for example 6-0 or 11-0 – the next match often becomes unplayable from the very start. I suddenly lose all control over my team and can only control one single player. Player Lock is turned off, my controller works perfectly in every other mode, and nothing on my end explains this behaviour.  This does not happen randomly. It only appears once I am on a good run – starting from 6-0 and higher.  At kickoff the opponent triggers something and the match becomes instantly unwinnable.  This feels exactly like the known input freeze or forced player lock exploit many players report hackers using on PC. It decides the outcome of the match before I can even play.  I am asking for an official response:  Is EA aware of this issue, and will there be a fix?  Right now it seems impossible to complete a legitimate Weekend League run without encountering players who abuse this exploit.  I simply want to enjoy FUT Champions without being sabotaged whenever I perform well. Please let us know what steps players should take and whether a solution is being worked on.

The rest of my matches were against AI, without any exploits or cheating. Since purchase, I’ve played 46 matches in total. Cheating offers me no benefit, and I don’t even have web market access.

Ahmed Azeeem,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/ahmed-azeeem/13112041,"I have been experiencing major issues with FC 2026 since its release. My main problem is with the pack and challenge rewards system. I have spent a significant amount of coins collecting packs from the in-game store—specifically, two packs costing 200,000 and 250,000 coins, totaling 450,000 coins.     Despite this, every pack I open contains only gold players. Similarly, I complete a very large number of challenges (SBCs and other objectives), but the rewards are the same—only gold players, with no new, high-rated, or valuable players. This has been extremely frustrating because I invested a lot of time and effort into the game expecting to receive competitive and useful players, but I have not benefited at all.     I have contacted EA support multiple times. They confirmed that there is no issue with my account and suggested that the problem may be server-related. While I appreciate their efforts to report the issue to the backend team, I have not received any compensation or solution so far. In most games, players are usually compensated when server or system-related problems prevent them from receiving fair rewards. In this case, I feel that I have lost both time and coins, and I now regret purchasing the game.     Collecting 450,000 coins was very time-consuming, and I hoped to get high-value players that I could use or trade to earn more coins. My request is simple: I am asking for a refund of the 450,000 coins I spent, or another fair solution to this issue.

Yeter,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/yeter/13111855,"Dear EA Sports Team,     I am writing to express my serious frustration with the current state of your game.     The gameplay feels completely broken. In important and decisive matches, my team suddenly becomes much slower, less responsive, and unable to perform basic actions properly. At the same time, the momentum is clearly shifted to the opposing team. This makes the game feel scripted rather than skill-based, and it removes all sense of fair competition.  What makes this situation even more unacceptable is the financial aspect. While the minimum wage in Turkey is 28,000 TL, I invested 50,000–60,000 TL into the game and was not able to obtain a single valuable card. Spending an amount that is far above the minimum wage and receiving nothing meaningful in return is extremely disappointing and unfair.  Because of these issues, both I and many people around me have stopped playing the game. I will also actively discourage my friends and community from spending money on FIFA Points or supporting this system. A game should reward skill and effort, not manipulate outcomes while encouraging excessive spending.  If these problems are not addressed seriously, you will continue to lose loyal players. I expect fair gameplay, transparency, and respect for players’ time and money.  Sincerely,",halilibo81,Newcomer,2026-01-19T02:09:00,2 days ago,FC 26 General Discussion,23,0,0

I am a long-time player of EA Sports FC, and I truly appreciate the continuous improvements you bring to the game each year. As you move forward with the development of FC27, I would like to share a small but meaningful feature suggestion regarding camera options.  For players who use the End-to-End camera angle, it would be extremely helpful to have an option to choose or fix the stadium direction so that the attacking direction in the first and second halves can be reversed or kept consistent, depending on player preference. Currently, the automatic switch of pitch direction between halves can feel disorienting for some players, especially those who rely heavily on spatial familiarity and visual orientation.  Allowing users to manually select the preferred direction (or lock it for both halves) would improve comfort, accessibility, and overall gameplay experience—particularly for competitive and long-session players.  Thank you for taking the time to consider this suggestion. I truly enjoy the FC series and look forward to seeing how FC27 evolves.

The core problem for FC 26.,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/the-core-problem-for-fc-26-/13110944,"I want to raise a serious concern regarding the online experience in FC 26 Ultimate Team, specifically since the launch of Team of the Year i took notice.  Over the past weeks, the gameplay quality has dropped dramatically to the point where matches often feel inconsistent or outright unplayable. The game has gone from terrible to horrible. issues many players are facing include:  Passes going astray with no logic, bouncing like table tennis balls  Tackles failing to register cleanly or being ignored altogether  Skill commands either delayed or not activating  Shots losing power or direction even when timed perfectly  These symptoms are not isolated gameplay tuning issues. What many players are experiencing aligns with input delay, packet loss and unstable latency — and this points to a much deeper issue: server infrastructure and routing.  Based on EA’s published list of FC game data centers, Europe currently includes: Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki, London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Tel Aviv, Warsaw, Zurich  While this appears to give broad coverage, the actual player experience tells a different story.  Large Parts of Europe Are Still Disadvantaged  There are millions of Ultimate Team players in countries such as:  Balkans (Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, etc.)  Greece  Finland beyond south  Eastern Europe (Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria)  Baltic nations  Even Norway and Sweden depending on routing  Many of these players routinely report:  High latency even during non-peak hours  Random spikes where gameplay speed changes mid-match  Feeling “delayed” compared to opponents  Poor matchmaking that connects across long distances  This is not due to local internet quality alone. It is a structural disadvantage caused by being physically far from a server or being routed incorrectly.  Competitive Integrity Is Impacted  Ultimate Team is:  A competitive online environment  A mode where rewards, placement, and economy matter  A game many players invest real money into  When the quality of gameplay depends on where a player lives rather than how well they play, fairness disappears.  Right now players benefit simply by living closer to London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam or Paris. Others are forced to play at a delay through no fault of their own. That is not competitive balance.  What Needs to Happen  For FC 26 and beyond to offer equal competition, EA should consider:  Expanding game data centers to more countries where Ultimate Team is heavily purchased and played  Improving routing logic so players consistently connect to the nearest available server  Increasing transparency on server status, load, and regional placement  Providing selectable regions or visible indicators for where players are connected  The player experience clearly shows demand for this — and it would improve fairness across the board.  The gameplay issues being widely reported are symptoms of systemic infrastructure strain. The Ultimate Team community deserves a level playing field regardless of postcode, not just proximity to an existing server hub.  If EA is committed to fair online competition, expanding and optimizing server coverage must be treated as a top priority.",BobbyBriggs,Seasoned Adventurer,2026-01-18T19:56:00,2 days ago,FC 26 General Discussion,34,0,0
EA FC 25 is definitely the worst game in history,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-25-general-discussion-en/ea-fc-25-is-definitely-the-worst-game-in-history/12108365,"I didn’t want to buy this game — I knew it was going to be a disaster. But like any fan of the series, curiosity got the better of me, so I bought it. Still, I couldn’t bring myself to play more than a few matches. The campaign mode is a complete disaster, and it honestly feels like it was designed that way on purpose, just to push everyone toward online play.  There’s no way to defend properly, and everything seems geared toward one goal: forcing us into the online mode. On top of that, there's the whole politically correct angle — where(probabily) they’re trying to make it so that even people with disabilities — like missing limbs — can score goals in the most popular football game on the planet!  The gameplay is a mess — passing doesn’t work, attacking AI is completely broken, and manual defending isn’t just ineffective, it’s actively punished. Add in the endless bounce backs, and the experience quickly becomes unbearable.  The menus? Well, if the gameplay is bad, at least the menus should make up for it, right? Wrong. The menus barely function. Constant freezing, display glitches, and an absurd increase in the number of clicks just to view your picks — all of it adds up to a terrible user experience.  Co-op is broken too. Let’s say you somehow overlook all the above issues and just want to enjoy some time with your friend in what used to be the best mode in FUT. Guess what? You’d better hope you’re not the away team — otherwise, you’ll get hit with an instant forfeit within five seconds of kickoff.  And it’s not about skill — I actually wish it was just that. Back in 2009, I was actually one of the top players in the series on Xbox. But nowadays, year after year, the defensive system keeps getting butchered in favor of the offensive side — as if, in the minds of these developers, football is only exciting when attacking, not defending. Then again, maybe it makes sense… after all, goalkeepers never win the Ballon d’Or.  I’m a longtime fan of the series. My first “FIFA” was back in 1997, and it was FIFA 96. Since then, I’ve played nearly every title in the franchise. And I’ll be honest — while the series has had its highs and lows, and some entries were even considered terrible, in all my years as a FIFA fan, I have never uninstalled a FIFA/FC game this quickly.  Usually, even with the weaker titles, I’d stick with them for a while — sometimes months. But this one?

During the Team of the Year (TOTY) promo (which started on January 16, 2026), I opened a 1-10 80+ pack and received a gold/base version of Claudia Pina (the regular 86-rated card). This pull happened after the TOTY items, including Claudia Pina’s TOTY card (rated 95), were released into packs.  Per the promo rules and community reports, standard gold versions of featured TOTY players should not appear in packs once their upgraded TOTY item is live—particularly in high-rated guarantee packs like the 1-10 80+. This appears to be an error, as the timing and pack type should have resulted in the TOTY version.  For reference, I have attached screenshots showing:   The new gold Pina card pulled from the 1-10 80+ pack (highlighted as new).  My previous Pina card (owned before TOTY, for comparison).

"BUG FACE CREATION (CLUBS, CARRER MODE)",https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/bug-face-creation-clubs-carrer-mode/12648882,"When creating a face in FC 26, there is an error when switching from Sculpt to Define. Normally, you work on the face in Sculpt until you have it the way you want it, but when you click Define without making any changes, the appearance of the face immediately changes.   Wrinkles become apparent and different textures appear.  The silhouette of the face also changes, even if no adjustments have been made in Define.  The problem is that the game often saves this aspect directly from Refine, even when nothing has been changed.  Consequently, the final face is not saved as it was created in Sculpt, but rather with the glitched version of Refine.    I've attached comparison images so you can clearly see the automatic switch between Sculpt and Define, even when no manual modifications have been applied.  Conclusion: This directly affects custom face creation, as it makes it impossible to save the finished work in Sculpt without it being altered by this error in Define.",Darwin6ix9,Seasoned Novice,2026-01-18T14:05:00,2 days ago,FC 26 Bug Reports,102,6,2

Why girls are overpowered in game ??,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/why-girls-are-overpowered-in-game-/13109780,"EA Sports FC26 has crossed a line that many long-time players find deeply frustrating and unacceptable. Mixing male and female players in competitive modes without respecting real-world physical differences has broken immersion and realism—the very foundations of a football simulation. Even more upsetting is how overpowered female players are made in gameplay: winning physical duels against larger male players, matching or exceeding strength and speed in ways that simply do not reflect real football.  This isn’t about disrespecting women or denying their achievements in football. Women’s football deserves its own space, balance, and celebration. The issue is forcing a mixed system while ignoring basic biological and athletic realities, which turns competitive modes into an arcade experience rather than a simulation. EA claims realism, yet sacrifices it for ideological choices that alienate a large part of its player base.  Players want choice. Separate modes, proper balancing, or the option to disable mixed teams would respect everyone. What’s happening now feels forced, immersion-breaking, and unfair. EA Sports FC built its reputation on authenticity—FC26 risks losing that identity by ignoring the very football logic fans fell in love with.",med_elcapone,Seasoned Newcomer,2026-01-18T10:07:00,2 days ago,FC 26 General Discussion,16,1,0

How about reducing or removing DDA altogether?,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/how-about-reducing-or-removing-dda-altogether/13108949,"I know you officially deny its existence, but it’s so obvious that we are fully aware of what’s going on. When so many of your players and content creators openly say “this system exists” and are unhappy with it, I honestly don’t understand why you insist on keeping a system that effectively decides which player is going to win the match. If I score a few goals in quick succession or take a few shots early in the match, my players inevitably forget how to pass, shot or dribble. I can already tell when DDA kicks in from what happens after goals or from the chances I fail to score (that your game does not allow me to score). From that moment on, my Incisive Pass+ player suddenly turns into a bronze card, and when I’m through on goal and aim my analog stick for a through ball, it’s as if the game doesn’t want me to score: instead of passing to the player in a clear scoring position, it tries to pass to another player standing 90 degrees to the right. The opponent’s Messi starts winning aerial duels against my 190 cm tall defender. I become completely unable to complete a third consecutive pass (even though before DDA kicked in I was playing tiki-taka like Barcelona). While all of my opponent’s passes go straight through the legs of my defender with 90+ defensive rating, my passes are intercepted with superhuman reflexes. My shots simply stop going in. About three shots hitting the post per match and every goalkeeper I face playing the best match of their career has become something I’m used to. A month ago, I was scoring several finesse shots from outside the box per match with Messi. Now, with the same Messi (with Finesse Shot+), every single one of those same shots (I’m not exaggerating, the rate is 100%) hits the post. This situation only ends when there is at least a 2–3 goal difference and the clock is between the 88th and 90th minute. It’s as if the game says, “It’s impossible to come back from this now, I’ll stop messing with you,” and once I pass that point of no return, my passes and shots suddenly start working properly again. Im so sick of getting outpaced by a 20pace slower player or keep missing perfectly timed penalties or or my players gifting the ball to the farthest opponent even though I touch passing button barely. How about putting a notification on my screen at kickoff saying, “This match has been decided that you will lose, don’t bother trying”?",WestPerincek,Rising Scout,2026-01-18T06:28:00,3 days ago,FC 26 Technical Issues,35,0,0

Meanwhile, TOTY cards might as well be Bigfoot — everyone talks about them but practically no one actually sees one.  Every weekend league feels like a punishment.  Every patch somehow makes things worse.  And every pack opening is just EA whispering,  “Thanks for your money and time, here’s a 83-rated left back from a team you’ve never heard of.”  So congrats EA — If beeing trash at everything was a skill, u have truly mastered it.

unfair company EA,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/unfair-company-ea/13108788,"Dear EA Team,     I am writing to express my serious concern regarding the recent Team of the Year (TOTY) promotions and recurring SBC-related issues that clearly undermine fair play.     Firstly, despite saving packs for weeks and opening over 80–90 packs during the TOTY release, I did not receive a single TOTY or promo card. Every pack resulted only in standard gold cards. This is extremely discouraging for players who invest time, effort, and in many cases money, specifically to participate in these limited-time promotions.     More importantly, a major SBC error occurred involving Lamine Yamal. For approximately 20 minutes, due to a mistake, players were able to complete the SBC and obtain Lamine Yamal for a squad costing roughly 40k coins. Shortly after, this error was corrected, and the real cost of the SBC increased to around 480k coins. As a result, thousands—possibly millions—of players gained a massive advantage simply because they were online during a short error window, while others now face a much higher cost for the same content.     This is not an isolated incident. Last year, a similar mistake occurred involving an Mbappé SBC, and again, no proper equalization or compensation was provided to ensure fairness among the player base. Unfortunately, this shows a pattern where critical errors benefit a limited group of players, while the rest are left behind without any corrective action.     These situations seriously damage competitive balance and trust in the game. Fair play cannot depend on being online at the exact minute an error happens. I strongly urge EA to address these issues properly and consider fair solutions for all affected players.     Thank you for taking the time to read this.",mckr08,Seasoned Newcomer,2026-01-18T02:53:00,3 days ago,FC 26 Feedback & Suggestions,23,0,0

This event only happens when starting a new save offline, and occurs on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles; unsure about PC platforms. Before the most recent squad update on January 14th, it was possible to start a new save logged into the EA account, navigate the setup configurations, advance to the first day of the career mode, dashboard the console, and re-enter career mode offline with the proper text displayed. Currently, since the squad update, regardless of starting a new save online or offline, the text glitch is always present. When conducting matches, at any point if the device disconnects from the network, the glitch appears instantly.

Anti-Cheat Failure,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/anti-cheat-failure/13102980,"Hello EA Support Team,  This is an urgent ""White Cursor"" Exploit report, Anti-Cheat Inadequacy, and Request for Compensation. I am formally complaining about the continued presence of a game-breaking exploit that has persisted for over two years, despite repeated promises of improved security systems.  For several seasons, I have consistently encountered a specific hack where a white cursor appears over all my players. This exploit:   Completely removes my ability to control or switch between players (except for a single player sometimes).  Triggers a game crash after 4–5 minutes if I attempt to wait the hacker out, resulting in a ""Loss"" and a ""DNF"" penalty.   The current anti-cheat system is a significant drain on my PC resources, yet it is clearly failing to prevent blatant external interference. It is unacceptable that a security layer consumes high CPU/RAM while failing to detect a script that literally hijacks player control.  I have manually searched for these accounts on the EA App to report and block them. However:   I have received zero feedback or confirmation of action taken.  The frequency of these encounters is increasing, suggesting that manual reporting and current automated blocks have no impact on the hacker's ability to matchmake.   To restore our confidence as customers, I am requesting the following:   Active In-Game Reporting: Implementation of a real-time, in-game reporting tool that captures the current match state and provides a fast-track feedback loop.  Compensation: A formal method of compensation (e.g., points, packs, or rank restoration) for the losses and penalties incurred due to your security team's inability to prevent this known exploit.  Technical Accountability: A clear update on why this specific ""white cursor"" exploit has remained unpatched for multiple titles.   For all the readers, please share other solutions you find accepted from your POV.  Fair play is the foundation of your product. Currently, the experience is neither fair nor functional. I look forward to a response that includes more than just a generic template.  *Attached are pictures for a 7-player skip while the match is being played only by me, a recent example of the issue.",MdieNstyle,Rising Traveler,2026-01-17T19:00:00,3 days ago,FC 26 General Discussion,63,2,1

Every time I try to launch a game I get this message:  “EA Javelin Anticheat encountered an error. Please restart your PC: C:\Program Files\EA\AC\EAAntiCheat.GameService.exe (7)(1)”  I’ve tried literally every fix available online — reinstalling EA AntiCheat, verifying files, running as admin, resetting permissions, even PowerShell scripts to repair the service — and nothing works.  The fact that a paid an EA PLAY PRO subscription, to play premium title like F1 25 ,FC 26, Battlefield 6 can’t even start because of a broken anti-cheat system is ridiculous. What’s worse, EA has not released a single official fix or response that actually works for everyone, despite so many players facing the same issue.  I’ve spent hours troubleshooting something that shouldn’t even be the player’s responsibility. If EA’s own security software prevents people from launching the game, then it’s EA’s job to fix it — not the community’s.  I’m posting this here because this problem clearly isn’t isolated.

I faced two different players in two consecutive matches, both using what appears to be pause/UI exploits or cheats. This is not an isolated incident anymore.     Match 1   Opponent was playing without a visible player selection indicator for a large part of the match.  After scoring, the indicator suddenly appeared.  Later, the match froze without any pause menu.  Players stopped moving, the match timer stopped, but crowd animations continued.  Shortly after, my game client froze / was forcibly minimized and the match ended abnormally.      Match 2   Opponent pressed pause.  Instead of a normal pause menu, a video/overlay appeared (similar to a menu background).  While this video was playing, the match continued in real time.  My controls were completely blocked, while the opponent could still play.      I have already reported both players in-game using the cheating/exploiting report option.  The reason I am posting here is simple: how are we supposed to play Champions or any competitive mode if we lose matches to cheats and exploits like this?  This directly affects competitive integrity and makes progression impossible when losses are caused not by gameplay, but by abuse of the pause system and UI.  I hope these cases can be reviewed, because right now it feels pointless to queue into competitive matches if this keeps happening.

FC 26 December Feedback Update,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/fc-26-december-feedback-update/13057507,"Welcome to the FC 26 December Feedback Update. 
 Today we’re sharing several changes coming in an early January update, based on your feedback. 
 Let’s kick things off with Game Designer Rory, who will walk through an upcoming change to AI Defending in the following video. 
 AI Defending 
 As we mentioned at the end of November, we’re continuing to run our own investigations and tests while reviewing all of your feedback. 
 In the next update, AI defenders will have slower reaction times when marking the ball carrier, which can result in them leaving more space open while transitioning between actions. 
 Before and after 
 New Releases Hub in Ultimate Team 
 We’ll be adding a New Releases hub in Ultimate Team that highlights new SBCs, Objectives, and more. 
 We’ll share more details closer to release.  See below for a sneak peak! 
    
   
 Squad Battles CPU AI 
 We’ve heard your feedback about the Squad Battles CPU AI becoming too difficult and frustrating to play against, especially on higher difficulties, due to its focus on maintaining possession. 
 With the next update, the Squad Battles CPU AI will now focus more on moving the ball up the pitch while creating chances quicker. 
 Career Mode Player Potential Indicator 
 In the last update, the UI added a new status indicator for a player’s willingness to renegotiate a contract, but it replaced the player potential indicator. 
 We’ll be bringing back the player potential indicator in an early January update based on your feedback, and the UI will display both indicators. 
 Thanks for checking out our December Feedback Update and for continuing to share your thoughts with us. Want to share your thoughts on these updates? Head to https://go.ea.com/fc26pfp 
 We hope you have a great end to 2025, and please keep your feedback coming here and over in our Official Discord Server: https://discord.gg/easportsfc",EA_Vendcera,Community Manager,2026-01-17T17:44:00,3 days ago,FC 26 Feedback & Suggestions,582,2,13

These issues started after recent updates and did not happen before. Disabling presentation visuals partially improves performance, which strongly suggests a bug in the PC presentation or rendering layer.  This is extremely disappointing for a full-price game. The PC version feels poorly optimized, unstable, and clearly inferior to the console versions.  Please forward these issues to the development team, especially:  - PC Career Mode stability  - UEFA Champions League intro crashes  - Input latency and frame timing on modern Intel CPUs     Thank you.",Levianath,Seasoned Newcomer,2026-01-17T12:40:00,3 days ago,FC 26 Bug Reports,49,1,0

Issue behavior (very specific):  As soon as FC25 launches, the image becomes globally darker while highlights are severely overexposed  The in-game brightness / HDR calibration menu is non-functional — changing values has almost no visible effect  When I Alt+Tab to the Windows desktop while FC25 is still running, the entire system display is affected (desktop and all applications appear incorrect)  Once FC25 is fully closed, the system immediately returns to normal  This clearly indicates that:  FC25 applies an incorrect HDR / gamma / EOTF mapping  The mapping is applied at a system or swap-chain level  FC25 fails to restore proper display state while running, even though it releases it on exit  Important clarifications:  This happens only with FC25  Other HDR-enabled games work correctly  Disabling HDR in-game does not resolve the issue  This is not a monitor, driver, or user configuration problem  The problem is not “brightness preference”.  It is a broken HDR pipeline and locked calibration state inside FC25.  Please escalate this to the rendering / display systems team.  Suggesting users to “disable HDR” or “update GPU drivers” is not an acceptable workaround for a system-level display bug.

Yesterday, the game was fluid and responsive. Today, the left-stick dribbling has been effectively ruined. Whether it was a stealth Live Tuning Update to account for the high scoring or just absolute server incompetence, the result is the same: you have killed the skill gap (agian!).  The Core Issues:   Turning Radius: My players (including elite players like Mbappé) now turn with a delay that feels like 3-4 frames of added latency. It’s like they have ""cement boots.""  Defensive ""Tethering"": You’ve buffed manual jockeying and AI tightness to the point where my dribbler is ""sucked into"" the defender's radius, making it impossible to pivot or exit a turn with any speed.  One-Touch Errand Passes: First-time passes that were surgical 24 hours ago are now flying wide. You are punishing manual precision and rewarding AI-assisted ""clogging"" of the midfield.   I play on a USB-Wired DualSense Edge specifically for input fidelity. If I can feel this level of ""Mud"" and unresponsiveness, the engine is broken. You’ve taken a game that was finally rewarding ""Pure"" football logic and turned it back into a slow, boring possession sim.  Fix the responsiveness or admit that you are deliberately nerfing attacking movement to protect the players who can't defend manually.    I'm getting awfully tired coming back week after week saying it's fixed and then to find you nerf it again and see it's ruined. I think you need to build the game from the ground up to compete with 2K and others entering the market. In the interim, I think less is more - we all agree Fifa 13 and 17 were the best because they had a cleaner base code, not years upon years of layered code. Please gut the excess coding and give us a clean dynamic game that feels, precise, quick and rewarding. This is getting ridiculous.

Request for PlayStyles Improvements in Career Mode – PS5,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/request-for-playstyles-improvements-in-career-mode-%E2%80%93-ps5/13106735,"Hello EA SPORTS FC Team,     I am writing to give feedback about the PlayStyles system in Manager Career Mode on PlayStation 5.     Career Mode is my favorite part of the game. I send scouts to search for young players, promote them to the first team, and try to build my dream squad. That is exactly why I play – to create the team I imagine.     The problem is the PlayStyles system.     At the moment, it is very difficult and frustrating to find youth players with useful PlayStyles. Most of the players generated by scouts come without important PlayStyles, and there is no way for me to add or develop them later.     This limits creativity and makes the experience less enjoyable.     I would like to suggest one of the following options:     - A setting that allows us to manually add PlayStyles to our own players  - A training system where players can earn new PlayStyles over time  - Scouts generating youth players with guaranteed or customizable PlayStyles  - More control over PlayStyles development in Career Mode     Career Mode should allow us to build players the way we dream, not depend only on luck.

Feedback for EA Regarding Gameplay Consistency in Ultimate Team,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-25-general-discussion-en/feedback-for-ea-regarding-gameplay-consistency-in-ultimate-team/13106710,"Feedback for EA Regarding Gameplay Consistency in Ultimate Team  I would like to provide feedback based on long-term experience with Ultimate Team across multiple titles. This is not meant as complaining — it is an attempt to highlight a core gameplay issue that significantly affects the competitive integrity of the mode.  Gameplay Inconsistency After Halftime  A very common and extremely frustrating pattern occurs in almost every match, regardless of whether it’s Squad Battles, Rivals, or any other UT mode:  • The first half plays normally.  • Players respond correctly, passes are accurate, movement feels natural.  • If I’m winning (or  losing) by halftime — for example 3–0 — the second half becomes a completely different game.  My team suddenly behaves as if their ratings dropped by 40 points:  • Players stop making basic runs.  • Simple 2‑meter passes fail repeatedly.  • First touches become random.  • Defenders freeze or ignore obvious runs.  • The entire team feels unresponsive and sluggish.  Meanwhile, the opponent — even with a weaker squad — suddenly becomes hyper‑responsive and boosted.  This doesn’t feel like football. It feels like an invisible mechanic is interfering with the match.  This Should Not Exist in a Competitive Mode  Ultimate Team is supposed to be the most competitive mode in the game. Yet these momentum‑like swings, dynamic difficulty adjustments, or whatever internal systems cause this behavior, have no place in a competitive environment.  Players want to win or lose based on:  • skill  • tactics  • team quality  • decision‑making  Not based on whether the game decides to “pull” one team forward and slow the other down.  Why This Drives Players Away  Every year, UT loses a significant portion of its player base. And honestly, this is one of the main reasons:  • Matches don’t feel consistent.  • Players don’t feel in control.  • Results often feel predetermined by hidden mechanics rather than gameplay.  • Even when you win, it doesn’t feel satisfying if the game artificially interferes.  If I lose 0–8 to a better player who uses skill moves, player lock, and understands the mechanics — that’s fine. That motivates me to improve.  But when I lose (or even win) because my team suddenly stops functioning after halftime, it’s simply frustrating and discouraging.  What Players Actually Want  A fair, consistent, skill‑based experience.  No momentum.  No hidden boosts.  No artificial handicaps.  No sudden second‑half collapses that feel scripted.  Just football — controlled by the player, not by invisible systems.",mdmT,Seasoned Traveler,2026-01-17T07:53:00,4 days ago,FC 25 General Discussion,24,0,0

PC Transfer market bans for legitimate trading,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-ultimate-team-en/pc-transfer-market-bans-for-legitimate-trading/13106374,"Hello everyone,  I wanted to share my experience and provide some feedback regarding recent Transfer Market bans on PC during the Team of the Year period.  My account received a Transfer Market ban for “coin distribution,” even though I have never bought or sold coins, never transferred coins between accounts, and never used any third-party tools or automation. All activity was done manually on a single account.  For context, my trading mainly took place during the start of TOTY, roughly between 19:00 and 01:00. I was trading commonly used SBC fodder in the 85–89 rating range (for example Hegerberg, Schüller or De Bruyne), bidding slightly below the current market price and reselling shortly after at market-consistent prices due to high SBC demand.  At peak times I had around 50–60 unassigned items, but I reduced this again and by the end of the evening / the following morning there were no unassigned items left. My coin balance fluctuated during the session (roughly from 2.0m down to 1.5m and back to around 1.9m from sales). A lot of value is currently tied up in my club, transfer list, transfer targets and SBC storage, which would result in additional coins once sold.  I also did some normal flipping and sniping, including special cards (for example Time-Wrapped Carvajal, Joga Bonito Murillo, Thunderstruck Çalhanoğlu) and TOTW cards close to discard value. Especially during TOTY, TOTWs drop heavily with supply and later rise again due to SBC requirements, which is a common and expected market pattern.  In my opinion the most hilarious point:  On the same day, I also purchased FC Points for 50€ to open packs. Not something a coin seller (or buyer) would do.   I did receive a few short soft bans for searching and filtering too frequently (for example when trying to snipe In-Forms or before certain price ranges were adjusted), but no warnings or restrictions beyond that until the Transfer Market ban.  TOTY is an extremely volatile time, especially on PC and Web App, with very high trading volume and rapid price movements. From what I’m seeing in the community, multiple PC players appear to be affected by similar bans despite engaging in normal trading behavior. This raises the concern that legitimate high-volume trading during major events may sometimes trigger false positives.  I fully support actions against coin selling.

FC 27,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-game-modes-en/fc-27/13106536,"Dear EA Sports Team,  I hope this message finds you well.  I am writing on behalf of a large portion of the EA Sports FC community to express a growing concern regarding the future of the game, particularly the Player Career Mode. A significant majority of players are seriously considering switching to the NBA 2K basketball series next year if no meaningful improvements are made to FC.  One of the main reasons for this potential shift is that NBA 2K treats a player’s career mode with great seriousness, depth, and consistent development. It is a mode that clearly receives attention and care, and we strongly believe it could serve as a positive example. We would genuinely recommend that the FC development team take inspiration from how NBA 2K handles its career experience.  Unfortunately, within the FC community there are many ongoing complaints about the Player Career Mode. While this mode exists in FC, it often feels neglected and lacking innovation, despite the strong interest from players who enjoy single-player and role-playing career experiences.  We share this feedback respectfully and constructively, as long-time supporters of the franchise. However, we would like to be honest: this upcoming release feels like the last opportunity for FC to show that Player Career Mode truly matters to the developers and the community alike.  Thank you for taking the time to read our message. We sincerely hope to see meaningful changes in the future and to continue supporting EA Sports FC for many years to come.  Kind regards,  A concerned EA Sports FC player",XarisZotos10,Seasoned Newcomer,2026-01-17T06:44:00,4 days ago,FC 26 Game Modes,43,0,0

Transfer Market Issue: Can Buy but Cannot Sell,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/transfer-market-issue-can-buy-but-cannot-sell/12660331,"Hi everyone, 
 I’m experiencing a problem with the Transfer Market on PS5 in EA FC 26. I completed the Foundations objectives on a new account and waited for the 24-hour timer to end. After that, I can buy players normally, but I cannot sell any players. 
 On PS4, the market works perfectly — I can buy and sell without issues. On PS5: 
 
 The minimum price for all players is stuck at 150, and the maximum is blank. 
 Attempting to sell triggers the message: “You’ve reached your limit on bid/buy actions. Please come back in 24 hours for full access.” 
 Clearing sold items or other actions in the Transfer List disconnects me with: “Connecting to Ultimate Team is not possible at the moment. You will now be returned to the main menu.” 
 
 This issue has persisted for several days after the timer ended and appears to be PS5-specific, likely a backend or server-side glitch.

If I close the game or turn off the console, the system registers me as the last player to disconnect and awards me a loss, even though I was winning (e.g. 6–2).

The gameplay is TERRIBLE, and every patch somehow manages to make it worse  It feels like a ping-pong arcade instead of football  Tackles constantly ping back to attackers like it’s scripted  Ball physics are a joke—random ricochets, rebounds, and magnet touches  Players feel heavy, sluggish, and unresponsive  Speed means absolutely nothing  Why do I have players with 95+ pace getting walked down by center backs with 70 pace?  What’s the point of upgrading squads if everyone plays the same?  Passing accuracy might as well be RNG  Simple passes go way off target  Overpowered through balls when you don’t want them  Underpowered passes when you're spamming the button  Tactics feel meaningless—everyone presses like Guardiola’s prime Barça   Midfields disappear, defenses collapse, players wander out of position  Custom tactics don’t behave consistently from match to match  AI teammates are unbelievably dumb  They jog, ball-watch, and never make the correct run  Opponent AI defends like prime Maldini and moves like it knows your inputs  FUT grind is painful and unrewarding  Rivals/SB/Champs all feel like chores, not fun  Pack weight is atrocious—hours of grinding for duplicate 82s  Market manipulation and fodder inflation ruin squad-building  One match your team feels elite  Next match they feel like bronze cards in quicksand  Input delay, latency, and weird animation locks ruin gameplay  Same meta tactics every weekend  Servers & Connectivity  Lag spikes  Invisible delay  Players not responding to commands  (But it’s always “your connection,” right?)  Overall There is no identity, no consistency, and nothing that rewards actual football knowledge or skill.  This should not be considered Esports. Gameplay is not there...  I’m done after this year.

Club Transfers and Team Sheets Broken By Classic Teams,https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/club-transfers-and-team-sheets-broken-by-classic-teams/13105232,"Absolutely insane, absurd glitches all over the place in Edit Teams. If too many players are transferred to/from a team, their formation is stuck in place and the players cannot be moved from their position at all. This happens until you literally transfer OUT every single player in that team's starting XI the re-transfer IN every player. Only then are you allowed to move players from position to position or to the bench.   Now the addition of Classic Teams shows just how little care and thought the devs put into this game. Zero consideration for the ripple effects of their awful execution of ideas. Players are now duplicated in their Classic XIs and their original clubs, so now they CANNOT be transferred out of the team ever.   For example, if you try to transfer a player like Alisson who is in both the current Liverpool squad and the Classic Liverpool squad, it won't work. Alisson will remain in the Liverpool squad.   Genuinely curious as to how the (re)occurrence of glitches and issues can be explained without showing that the devs are lazy and don't really care at all.",58a8d17912b51508,New Spectator,2026-01-16T20:16:00,4 days ago,FC 26 Bug Reports,39,1,0
Manual Defending,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/manual-defending/13105231,What is up with the manual defending and I mean seriously. No matter how perfectly I position my defender for an interception it’s a toss up on if my player will actually lift their foot to intercept. The ball will LITERALLY roll over their foot and they’ll do nothing. Tackling is more consistent than intercepting but I’ll run into the same problem going for a tackle occasionally and even then it’s another coin flip on if it’s a bounce back or not. I understand the ai defending nerf I really do but how are the inconsistencies in the manual defending not being talked about here. It just seems incredibly unrewarding and probably a huge reason the ai defending needed to be abused in the first place. Also feel the need to note that at this point in the game my whole back line and cdms have either intercept+ or base along with some serious defending stats so that the players shouldddddntttt be the issue right?

When I sold the card, I listed it approximately 10,000 coins below the average market value to ensure a quick and fair sale. This was a normal market decision and not intended to manipulate prices or transfer coins between accounts. I genuinely do not understand how this action violates the Transfer Market rules.

These experiences go beyond the cards you draw. Keep enjoying those moments, and see each pack as a new opportunity. Sometimes, taking a break and coming back with a fresh perspective can make all the difference. Keep your passion alive, and your luck will eventually catch up.        are you going to refund the 100 dollars on a the rigged packs i just bought as its straight gambling with worse odds then a casino and with a casino you actually win something you can use in day to day living not pixels     Read • 10:25 AM  H  Unfortunately, in-game purchases can't be refund from our side please do accept my sincere apologies.     all your saying is just spend more money and the luck will come.. how much money do people have to spend to get such luck is the question how do EA get away with having such gambling odds and it also be available to children and young kids to get a gambling addiction from?     then put me onto someone that can refund that purchase because that's down right stealing my money.

It is not fair that there is people that completed the sbc before EA announced that was a mistake and did not get the player removed from their club, I did it before knowing it was a mistake. I have looked everywhere for the player, unnassigned items, my club, sbc storage and I don’t have it even though I claimed the reward. And now they came out saying that it was a mistake.

It’s like the match never existed.  Is this a known bug or something EA is working on? I’ve seen it happen a couple of times now, and it really ruins the competitive side of Seasons when players can quit without consequence.

Anti-Cheat Failure,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/anti-cheat-failure/13104577,"Hello EA Support Team,  This is an urgent ""White Cursor"" Exploit report, Anti-Cheat Inadequacy, and Request for Compensation. I am formally complaining about the continued presence of a game-breaking exploit that has persisted for over two years, despite repeated promises of improved security systems.  For several seasons, I have consistently encountered a specific hack where a white cursor appears over all my players. This exploit:   Completely removes my ability to control or switch between players (except for a single player sometimes).  Triggers a game crash after 4–5 minutes if I attempt to wait the hacker out, resulting in a ""Loss"" and a ""DNF"" penalty.   The current anti-cheat system is a significant drain on my PC resources, yet it is clearly failing to prevent blatant external interference. It is unacceptable that a security layer consumes high CPU/RAM while failing to detect a script that literally hijacks player control.  I have manually searched for these accounts on the EA App to report and block them. However:   I have received zero feedback or confirmation of action taken.  The frequency of these encounters is increasing, suggesting that manual reporting and current automated blocks have no impact on the hacker's ability to matchmake.   To restore our confidence as customers, I am requesting the following:   Active In-Game Reporting: Implementation of a real-time, in-game reporting tool that captures the current match state and provides a fast-track feedback loop.  Compensation: A formal method of compensation (e.g., points, packs, or rank restoration) for the losses and penalties incurred due to your security team's inability to prevent this known exploit.  Technical Accountability: A clear update on why this specific ""white cursor"" exploit has remained unpatched for multiple titles.   For all the readers, please share other solutions you find accepted from your POV.  Fair play is the foundation of your product. Currently, the experience is neither fair nor functional. I look forward to a response that includes more than just a generic template.  *Attached are pictures for a 7-player skip while the match is being played only by me, a recent example of the issue.",MdieNstyle,Rising Traveler,2026-01-16T13:35:00,4 days ago,FC 26 Technical Issues,24,0,0

If an opponent powers off their console or PC or disconnects while you're playing/winning a game in Seasons the match is not registered and you do not get the win. In previous years this only happened when cross-play was enabled. But if you turned cross-play off and only played against people using the same console it didn't happen. Now, it happens whether cross-play is enabled or not. THIS MAKES SEASONS COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE. It happens almost every time someone quits. It's been ongoing for months. I test it after every update but the issue remains. I've been playing Seasons every year since it was introduced. I've never known this to happen before. I currently cannot play the game mode I play.    One of the claims made when promoting the new game was that you'd fixed this issue. However, it is now worse than it was before. In fact, I've never known it to be so bad.     This issue needs addressing above all others.

Being able to customize a formation with clear limits for balance would make tactics feel more personal and creative. I think this would make squad building more fun, allow players to express their own playstyle, and add tactical depth without hurting competitive balance.

Manager Career Mode Needs Meaningful Evolution,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-game-modes-en/manager-career-mode-needs-meaningful-evolution/13103509,"Dear EA Sports Team,     I’m writing as a long-time player who has been with the franchise since FIFA 09, and someone who has played Manager Career Mode religiously for the past four years.     Every year, I buy the game hoping that Career Mode will take a meaningful step forward. Unfortunately, it feels like the mode has remained stagnant—and in some areas, even taken steps backward.     People who play Manager Career Mode want to live the life of a football manager. That means more than just matchday gameplay. It means strategy, identity, long-term planning, accountability, and standing by your decisions. Over time, many of these elements have either been limited or removed altogether.     Some examples:  - We no longer have the freedom to create our own formations and tactical ideas.  - The removal of requesting funds took away an important managerial responsibility. It would be far more immersive to allow managers to make a case to the board—based on performance, vision, squad needs, or long-term plans—and stand by that justification rather than having budgets be static.  - Out-of-game animations have barely changed for years. Individual creators using AI can now generate better animations than what we see in Career Mode—let alone a company of EA’s scale.     There are also many realistic systems that could dramatically improve immersion:  - Buy-back clauses and more advanced contract structures  - Multi-club ownership, where a “sister club” can be used for player development (similar to Man City and Girona), including shared academy philosophy and long-term group identity  - A manager career leaderboard based solely on real-life managers, allowing players to compare long-term achievements against legends like Sir Alex Ferguson or Pep Guardiola  - A proper manager contract system, where contracts have fixed durations and must be renewed. Managers should be able to resign voluntarily, fail renewal negotiations, or allow contracts to expire. In these cases, the game should continue along the same timeline, allowing the manager to remain unemployed—without access to club operations—until a suitable role from their job watchlist becomes attainable  - Club legacy leaderboards, enabling comparisons between a player-built club and historic giants like Real Madrid in terms of trophies and achievements  - Smarter scouting, driven by player profiles and positional needs rather than generic results  - Tactical support tools, offering guidance on how to approach or counter an opponent’s style or formation for players who may not fully understand tactical matchups  - A meaningful use for manager wages—right now they’re just numbers. In reality, some managers prioritize legacy and trophies, while others value financial success. Reflecting that choice would add depth and personality to Career Mode.     Honestly, it often feels like Career Mode is no longer a priority at EA. While gameplay continues to receive attention, a set of focused, relatively minor updates like these could completely transform the experience for millions of players who prefer an immersive single-player mode over Ultimate Team.     Career Mode has enormous potential. Many of us simply want to see it treated with the same ambition and care as other parts of the game.     Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope this feedback reaches the teams responsible for shaping the future of Manager Career Mode.     Kind regards,  Long-time EAFC Player",hashemqudah,Newcomer,2026-01-16T07:27:00,5 days ago,FC 26 Game Modes,30,0,0

Steps to Reproduce:   Go to Team Management and edit your squad (offline).  Save the changes.  Close the game completely.  Restart the game.  Check squads → they revert to default instead of keeping your custom lineup.   Expected Result: Custom squads should remain saved after restarting the game, as in previous FC titles.  Actual Result: Squads reset to default every time the game restarts.  (Workaround) Found:   After saving squads, restart the game.  Enter Career Mode → select Original.  Once it loads, immediately exit Career Mode.  Return to Squad Management → custom squads are now saved correctly.   Impact: This bug affects offline players who want to prepare squads in advance for Kick-Off matches against friends. It reduces usability compared to previous versions where squads stayed saved permanently  Additional Problem: Every time I edit more squads (multiple teams), the gameplay becomes unstable and performance issues appear.

EA SPORTS FC 26 – Random Crashes (Access Violation / Software NX Fault),https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/ea-sports-fc-26-%E2%80%93-random-crashes-access-violation--software-nx-fault/12686291,"Platform: PC (Windows 10 x64, Version 26100 build)  Game Version: 1.0.0.0 (Steam)  Anti-Cheat: Installed & repaired  Hello,  My game keeps crashing at random, no matter what mode I play — Kick Off, Career, Ultimate Team, or even Training. The crash usually happens after a few minutes into gameplay (5–15 minutes on average). The whole screen freezes or goes black, and then the game closes. This does not happen in any of my other games, only FC 26.  I have already updated the game to the latest patch through Steam/EA App, repaired the installation, reinstalled EA AntiCheat, and installed the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables. My graphics drivers and Windows are also up to date.  For your reference, I have analyzed the crash dumps in WinDbg. They consistently point to access violations inside FC26.exe and Engine.Render.Core2.PlatformPcDx12.dll, with errors such as:  INVALID_POINTER_READ  INVALID_POINTER_WRITE  SOFTWARE_NX_FAULT (Attempt to execute non-executable memory)  Even though the dumps list FC26.exe as version 1.0.0.0, the game is fully updated — EA doesn’t seem to update the internal version metadata in the .exe, so it still shows the launch version. Please note: this is not the maiden build, I am on the most recent patch (as of Sept 30, 2025).  In short:  The game crashes randomly, in any mode, usually while playing a match.  No other games on my PC crash.  Dumps confirm repeated memory access violations in the Frostbite engine modules.  All system and runtime updates are installed.  This strongly suggests the issue is not on my end but a bug in the game itself. Please escalate to the development team so they can patch it. I am happy to provide the crash dump files if needed.  Thank you.  Problem  The game consistently crashes after a few minutes of play (between 5–20 minutes).  The entire PC does not crash — only the game (black screen → forced exit).  No other games on my system have this issue, only EA SPORTS FC 26.  Steps Already Tried  Repaired EA AntiCheat (successfully reinstalled and verified).  Repaired game files through Steam.  Updated GPU drivers and Windows.  Installed latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables (x64).  Ran with launch options -dx11 and without overlays.  Tested both with and without DS4Windows/controller software.  Crash Dump Analysis  Using WinDbg, every crash shows an Access Violation (c0000005) inside either FC26.exe or Engine.Render.Core2.PlatformPcDx12.dll (Frostbite engine DirectX 12 module).  Examples:  INVALID_POINTER_READ → Engine.Render.Core2.PlatformPcDx12.dll!rc2DeviceInit  INVALID_POINTER_WRITE → FC26.exe!SoftMaxNormalize  SOFTWARE_NX_FAULT (non-executable memory execute attempt) → 0x6f000095fa inside FC26.exe  Crash dump references:  CrashDump_2025.09.30_16.01.47.511.mdmp  CrashDump_2025.09.30_17.22.56.468.mdmp  CrashDump_2025.09.30_19.29.41.577.mdmp  All point to memory access violations in Frostbite rendering code or FC26.exe main thread.",barrybarryjo,New Spectator,2026-01-15T19:58:00,5 days ago,FC 26 Bug Reports,2900,16,11

As a dedicated player, I believe the following points need urgent attention:  1. Gameplay & Servers:   * Server Latency: We are experiencing significant input lag and slow server response in the Middle East, making H2H play very frustrating.   * Goalkeepers: GKs currently feel underpowered. Finesse shots score nearly 100% of the time; keepers need a buff to be more effective.   * Defensive AI: Player positioning in H2H and Manager Mode is often poor, especially during defensive transitions.   * Substitutions: We request increasing the number of substitutions to 5 or 6 per match to manage player stamina better.  2. Fair Play & Graphics:   * Hacker Issues: There is a noticeable increase in hackers (disconnect cheats and speed hacks). We need a more robust anti-cheat system.   * Graphics: The visual quality has not seen significant improvements since launch. We hope for a graphical update for modern devices.  3. Regional & Economy Issues (Jordan):   * Web Store Access: The FC Mobile Web Store is not working in Jordan, even when trying various troubleshooting methods. We need this fixed for our region.   * Game Economy: There are delays in reward distribution, and the game is becoming too focused on ""Pay-to-Win"" mechanics. We want to see the return of better pack systems for all players.  We hope the development team takes this feedback into consideration for future updates.

FC 26 on PC – Ongoing Gameplay Slowdown and Input Delay Issues,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/fc-26-on-pc-%E2%80%93-ongoing-gameplay-slowdown-and-input-delay-issues/13065256,"Hello EA Team,  I’m posting to raise awareness about a persistent gameplay issue I’ve been experiencing in EA SPORTS FC 26 on PC, which has made the game increasingly frustrating to play.  What’s happening  In multiple modes — including Clubs, Ultimate Team (Rivals/Champions) and Squad Battles — gameplay starts off feeling normal and responsive. However, after a short period of time, the match consistently becomes slow and unresponsive, with noticeable input delay. Player actions feel delayed, turning becomes sluggish, and the overall pace of the game feels as if it is running in slow motion.  This change happens mid-match, not at kickoff, and once it starts, it usually persists for the rest of the game.  Why this doesn’t seem network-related  My connection indicators are consistently green, with low ping.  I experience the same slowdown in Squad Battles, which are played against AI and do not depend on online matchmaking.  FC 25, which is still installed on my system, runs smoothly online under the same internet conditions.  Other online games on my PC do not suffer from similar issues.  Based on this, the problem appears to be specific to FC 26, rather than my internet setup.  System and performance context  My PC comfortably meets EA’s recommended requirements for FC 26. I’ve also tried extensive troubleshooting on my end, including graphics adjustments, driver updates, cache clearing, and system optimizations. While these steps sometimes make the game feel slightly better for a short time, the slowdown and input delay eventually return, often within minutes.  Overall impact  I was genuinely looking forward to FC 26, but the current state of gameplay on PC has made it difficult to enjoy or compete consistently. The fact that many other PC players are reporting the same pattern of delayed and slow gameplay suggests this may be a wider issue that needs attention.  Request for acknowledgment  I’m posting this not just to vent frustration, but to ask for acknowledgment and investigation into the ongoing performance and input delay issues affecting FC 26 on PC. Any communication, updates, or insight from the development team would be greatly appreciated.

TOTY edition is a joke,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/toty-edition-is-a-joke/13101525,"EA has released a TOTY Edition for £49.99 that includes the base game plus additional content.     However, players who pre-ordered or bought the Standard Edition at launch paid £69.99, and those who bought Ultimate paid even more.     What doesn’t make sense is that Standard Edition owners could have waited until January and paid £20 less, while also receiving extra TOTY content. Instead, early buyers paid more money for less value.     Discounts later in the game cycle are expected, but releasing a cheaper edition that includes added content — while giving nothing at all to players who bought at full price — effectively penalises those who supported the game early.     Pre-order and full-price players get no compensation, no equivalent content, and no acknowledgement, despite paying the most.     This discourages buying the game at launch and sends the message that waiting for promotions is the better option.

Premium Season Pass Glitch,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/premium-season-pass-glitch/13101289,"Today I was grinding some XP to get myself up the season pass. I reached level 27 which grants you 3k more xp, I then done around another 3k XP, which got me to level 32. But my status bar hadn’t changed, it still said I was level 26. I could claim the rewards until level 31 so I did so, thinking it would reset the status bar and have me level 32/33 where I should be. It did not do that, I thought I would do some more objectives to see if it would allow me to move up levels, but that didn’t work either. So now I’m stuck, I need the rewards I was grinding for so I can complete some players I want, but I can’t do anything.

 Play Football Ultimate Team™ now and check out the official Men's and Women's Team of the Year XIs, comprised of some of the very best players from across The World’s Game over the last calendar year. 
 BUILD YOUR TOTY HONOURABLE MENTION EVO 
 Celebrate awards season by creating your very own Team of the Year Honourable Mention midfield maestro. 
 From 16 January, choose your journey through a Team of the Year-chained Evolution. What does your team need most, a colossal CDM to protect the back line, a box-to-box CM to bridge the gap between defence and attack, or a magic CAM to pull the strings in the final third? The choice is yours. 
 Begin by choosing an eligible Player Item (Max 86 OVR/Max 4 Positions) and start their path through the Build your TOTY HM EVO 1. Once they have the TOTY HM Evolution Item Rarity, depending on your player’s position or alternate position, they’ll now qualify for the TOTY HM CAM Builder (Rewards Finesse PlayStyle+), the TOTY HM CM Builder (Rewards Tiki Taka PlayStyle+), or the TOTY HM CDM Builder (Rewards Anticipate PlayStyle+). But your TOTY HM journey doesn’t end there. 
 After completing the above, your eligible TOTY HM Evolution Player Item will now qualify for a potential second PlayStyle+, beginning 23 January. Options include the First Touch PlayStyle+, Long Ball PlayStyle+, or the Press Proven PlayStyle+. 
 To give you more options than ever, players that login to Football Ultimate Team™ during the campaign will be granted 3 different Evolution consumables (Max 86 OVR/Max 3 Positions/Max 90 PAC) that grant position changes from ST->CAM, LM/RM->CM, or CB->CDM. Make sure to apply these before starting the Build your TOTY HM Evolution experience. 
 FAQ 
 Q. There are multiple Evolutions, can I use multiple players in this Evolution? 
 No - The first player you choose will be the only player eligible. Remaining Evolutions will require you to have the TOTY HM Evo item rarity. 
 Q. What is the release schedule for these Evolutions? 
 
 Friday January 16th
 
 Build your TOTY HM EVO 
 TOTY HM CAM Builder 
 TOTY HM CM Builder 
 TOTY HM CDM Builder 
 
 
 Friday January 23rd
 
 TOTY HM Press Proven+ 
 TOTY HM First Touch+ 
 TOTY HM Long Ball Pass+ 
 
 
 
 Q. Do I need to complete the Evolutions in order? 
 Yes - you need to complete the 'Build your TOTY HM Evo' to earn the TOTY HM Evo rarity for your player. Once you have the rarity you can move onto CAM/CM/CDM Builder, and then you can choose between the final 3 Evolutions for your 2nd PS+ releasing on Friday January 23rd. 
 Q. My Player already has 1 PS+, what happens if I submit them into this? 
 Your player item would only get one additional PS+, they would be able to add a second PS+ in the final 3 Evolutions for the second PS+ releasing on Friday January 23rd. If you submit a player who has no PlayStyle+’s, your player will receive both PS+ upgrades. 
 Q. What will be my players final OVR? 
 Your player item's final OVR after completing the multi-step Evolution journey would be 89. 
 Q. I was granted 3 Evolution Position Consumables (ST -> CAM, LM/RM -> CM, CB -> CDM), do I need to use them on this Evolution? 
 No, you are free to use these consumables on any qualified player item, these do not grant you the TOTY HM Evo rarity.",EA_Vendcera,Community Manager,2026-01-15T09:11:00,6 days ago,EA SPORTS FC™ 26 Game Info Hub,69,0,0

Goalkeeper classified “too old”,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-feedback-en/goalkeeper-classified-%E2%80%9Ctoo-old%E2%80%9D/12954078,"In my manager career mode, as soon as goalkeeper turns over 30, they get classified as too old. They’re not allowed to be selected for team play, but they can be sold or purchased regardless of this classification. This doesn’t make any sense. Especially since goalkeepers can play well into their late 30s. It also happens without any warning so in the middle of my season, I suddenly have my starting goalkeeper unavailable. The game doesn’t know any different either and the player will start complaining about not giving playing time, so it’s not like they Auto retired. I really hope this gets fixed as soon as possible.",9fd7a5e3708f2a15,Rising Newcomer,2026-01-15T07:59:00,6 days ago,FC 26 Feedback & Suggestions,53,0,1

Last-Minute Celebrations & Camera Angles Not Working in FC26,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-technical-issues-en/last-minute-celebrations--camera-angles-not-working-in-fc26/13072187,"One of the most iconic parts of EAFC has always been the dramatic last-minute winner celebrations. That rush when you score in stoppage time and the game cuts to those unique, emotional celebration scenes is a huge part of what makes goals feel special.  However, in FC26, these last-minute celebrations don’t seem to be working at all. Even when scoring a clear late winner, the special celebration sequences simply don’t activate.  On top of that, there’s a new issue where regular goals (not just last-minute ones) often trigger strange camera angles instead of proper celebrations — like an overhead view looking straight down at the pitch or a wide half-pitch camera. It completely kills the moment and immersion.  This isn’t just a small visual issue:   I run a Pro Clubs TikTok account with 1,500 followers, and celebrations are a massive part of creating engaging content.  These moments are what make goals exciting, shareable, and memorable.  For everyday players, celebrations add adrenaline, emotion, and personality to the game, especially in Pro Clubs.   Right now, scoring sometimes feels flat and unfinished, even when it should be the most hype moment of the match.  I really hope this gets acknowledged and fixed, because celebrations are more than just animations, they’re a core part of the EAFC experience for both players and content creators.

Squad Management Broken for Months – 15-Year League Still Unable to Play,https://forums.ea.com/idea/fc-26-bug-reports-en/squad-management-broken-for-months-%E2%80%93-15-year-league-still-unable-to-play/13100659,"This is a plea, not a rant.  We are a 15-year-old FIFA league, about 20 players, spread all over Europe. Simulating games, negotiating, making role-play-posts.   Different cities, different lives — but once a year we come together for the same ritual: the draft.  We already did it.  We celebrated it.  We planned the season.  And now we can’t play.  Why? Because core team-management features in EA FC 26 are broken — and have been for months.  For our league, Kick-Off mode with custom squads and tactics is essential. We don’t use Ultimate Team. We don’t want monetization features. We need:  -Working transfers  -Reliable squad editing  -Functional tactical changes  -Stable team management across multiple squads  Right now, none of this works properly.  Transfers don’t save or revert.  Players can’t be moved between positions.  Tactics don’t apply.  Editing multiple squads leads to crashes (CE-108255-1).  And since the World Selection update, players appearing in multiple squads can’t be transferred at all.  So the result is absurd: We have the teams. We have the lineups. We have the league. But the game won’t let us play football.  Every update, someone in our group asks:  “Is it fixed now?”  It never is.  This isn’t a niche request.  This is basic football game functionality.  And for us — and many others — it’s the entire reason to play.  We’re still here.  Still waiting.  Still hoping someone finally treats this as the critical bug it is.  Please fix squad management.  Please let us play the season we already built.",bbe64ow7pdpr,Seasoned Novice,2026-01-15T07:18:00,6 days ago,FC 26 Bug Reports,18,0,0

Why Do You Make Squad Battles so difficult?,https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/why-do-you-make-squad-battles-so-difficult/12903777,"Squad Battles has for many years been an horrendous game mode, which many feel has got progressively worse. As a lot of objectives now involve Squad Battles, you are basically forcing players to go into this terrible game mode. There are so many things within SB matches that don't feel right, and quite frankly are unfair to the user. Why ?  Examples:  When you can't get the ball off the AI, you know they are going to score (9/10 times)  When the AI have a succession of corners (regardless of time being up), they will score.  AI players with little or no shooting abilities, score screamers.  AI players with low dribbling will walk through your team to score.  Short AI players will outjump your tall player  Weak AI players will bully your strong player.  Your pacey players will often get caught up by a much slower AI.  AI passing is always perfect, while yours is random.  If your strikers have 99 shooting, they will often miss from in front of goal.  Low rated outfield AI players as Goalkeeper, will pull off amazing saves.  Press shoot - delay - tackled  press tackle - delay - nothing happens  (or concede a penalty/ free kick/ red card)  Tell player to make a forward run - he doesn't and you can lose possession while you wait.     There are many more things that happen in Squad Battles, these are just a few examples.  The game-play seems so geared towards the AI, and to making your life so much more difficult than it needs to be.

"Wrongfully banned account , first appeal automatically denied",https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-ultimate-team-en/wrongfully-banned-account--first-appeal-automatically-denied/13098694,"The things I've had to deal with in the past days are ridiculous so I'm going to share my experience here for people that might face a similar situation. I will give updates below this post if anything happens in the meantime.    A couple days ago i got an email in the middle of the night, saying i was permanently banned from FC 26.    I can only guess why i have been banned for ''coin transfer'', as the email stated, but its ridiculous that the automated ban system even flags an account for what I'm about to share.    I play on PC, which has a much smaller playerbase than console, which means the transfer market is a lot less active in comparison. I was awake super late at night for a couple days (around 5am GMT+1), so i started trading, bidding on hundreds of more expensive, rare cards, since they can fluctuate in price a lot. They can potentially make you a lot of profit if you get lucky and win one of those bids, which i eventually did. A few each night, maybe 1 out of 20 players i was bidding on. All this data is easily accessible data for EA. Of course, i then sold those players for the price they were selling for at that point in time.     What's most ridiculous to me is, that it is literally impossible to transfer coins through bid? Like, everyone could just bid on the same players I make a bid on, which people did on most of them.   Why am i being punished for normally using the transfer market?  I understand that this might have been issued by an automated system, but why has my first ban appeal been denied almost immediately, without anyone actually looking into things? It should be blatantly obvious that i haven't done anything against the TOS.    How is this the way a long time paying customer that never had any problems with their account in any way shape or form is being treated?  I've spent countless hours (900+ just in FC 26) and a lot of money this year again, while passionately building my account to where it is right now, just to get banned right before the biggest promo of the year? I have already missed out on a lot of things that expired over the last days. Why would I ever participate in coin transfer, when I barely ever even use expensive players bought on the transfer market? Easily 80% of the players I use are evolutions, with the other 20% probably being 15% SBC players.  Also, why would I ever be stupid enough to risk my account, that has been in good standing for many years? There is countless more reasons why none of this makes any sense.    My case has been stuck at ''Waiting on Studio'' for DAYS now.  I'm not even sure if i will get my account back at this point, since i have not heard any reasoning for my ban other than the general topic.    I'm beyond frustrated and scared that i will not be unbanned since I unfortunately haven't had a single positive experience with EA Help this far.    I have also opened another case with a ''Data Subject Access Request'', basically asking for them to send me the market data related to my account so i can prove that i haven't done anything wrong. No response for this case yet.  If anyone has any idea what options I still have, please let me know, I'm desperate for anything that  could help me solve this misunderstanding at this point.",Cr4xXttv,Seasoned Rookie,2026-01-14T18:36:00,6 days ago,EA SPORTS FC™ 26 Ultimate Team,34,0,0

The issue is clearly online-related  It does not appear nearly as bad when playing against AI  It can appear suddenly after one match, without changing any settings      I have exhausted all local troubleshooting  To remove any doubt that this could be a user-side issue, I have already done the following:   Fresh Windows reinstall  Fresh game reinstall  Fresh NVIDIA driver reinstall   Tested multiple different controllers:   Xbox controller  DualSense  Razer controller  8BitDo controller   Wired connections and wireless  Tried all common performance and latency settings:   60 FPS locks  V-Sync ON / OFF  G-SYNC OFF  Different refresh rates  Fullscreen vs borderless  Power plans, USB power saving, overlays disabled      None of this resolves the issue.  I just want to understand what is actually broken here, because in its current state the game is completely unplayable.",Mazhudir,New Novice,2026-01-14T14:28:00,6 days ago,FC 26 Technical Issues,47,0,0
